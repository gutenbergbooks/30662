<p class="titles_large">THE STORY<br />
OF A NEW YORK HOUSE.
</p>


<h2>I.</h2>


<p>"I hear," said Mrs. Abram Van Riper,
seated at her breakfast-table, and watching
the morning sunlight dance on the front
of the great Burrell house on the opposite side
of Pine Street, "that the Dolphs are going to
build a prodigious fine house out of town&mdash;somewhere
up near the Rynders's place."</p>

<p>"And I hear," said Abram Van Riper, laying
down last night's <i>Evening Post</i>, "that
Jacob Dolph is going to give up business.
And if he does, it's a disgrace to the town."</p>

<p>It was in the summer of 1807, and Abram
Van Riper was getting well over what he considered
the meridian line of sixty years. He
was hale and hearty; his business was flourishing;
his boy was turning out all that should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2" href="#Page_2">[2]</a></span>
have been expected of one of the Van Riper
stock; the refracted sunlight from the walls of
the stately house occupied by the Cashier of
the Bank of the United States lit with a subdued
secondary glimmer the Van Riper silver
on the breakfast-table&mdash;the squat teapot and
slop-bowl, the milk-pitcher, that held a quart,
and the apostle-spoon in the broken loaf-sugar
on the Delft plate. Abram Van Riper was
decorously happy, as a New York merchant
should be. In all other respects, he was
pleased to think, he was what a New York
merchant should be, and the word of the law
and the prophets was fulfilled with him and in
his house.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," Mrs. Van Riper began again,
somewhat querulously, "I can't see why Jacob
Dolph shouldn't give up business, if he's so
minded. He's a monstrous fortune, from all I
hear&mdash;a good hundred thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"A hundred thousand dollars!" repeated
her husband, scornfully. "Ay, and twice twenty
thousand pounds on the top of that. He's
done well, has Dolph. All the more reason he
should stick to his trade; and not go to lolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3" href="#Page_3">[3]</a></span>
in the sun, like a runner at the Custom-House
door. He's not within ten years of me, and
here he must build his country house, and set
up for the fine gentleman. Jacob Dolph! Did
I go on his note, when he came back from
France, brave as my master, in '94, or did I
not? And where 'ud he have raised twenty
thousand in this town, if I hadn't? What's
got into folks nowadays? Damn me if I can
see!"</p>

<p>His wife protested, in wifely fashion. "I'm
sure, Van Riper," she began, "you've no need
to fly in such a huff if I so much as speak of
folks who have some conceit of being genteel.
It's only proper pride of Mr. Dolph to have a
country house, and&mdash;"(her voice faltering a
little, timorously) "ride in and&mdash;and out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Ride!</i>" snorted Mr. Van Riper. "In a
carriage, maybe?"</p>

<p>"In a carriage, Van Riper. You may think
to ride in a carriage is like being the Pope of
Rome; but there's some that knows better.
And if you'd set up your carriage," went on
the undaunted Mrs. Van Riper, "and gone
over to Greenwich Street two years ago, as I'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4" href="#Page_4">[4]</a></span>
have had you, and made yourself friendly with
those people there, I'd have been on the
Orphan Asylum Board at this very minute;
and <i>you</i> would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Van Riper knew all that speech by
heart, in all its variations. He knew perfectly
well what it would end in, this time, although
he was not a man of quick perception: "He
would have been a member of the new Historical
Society."</p>

<p>"Yes," he thought to himself, as he found
his hat and shuffled out into Pine Street; "and
John Pintard would have had my good check
in his pocket for his tuppenny society. Pine
Street is fine enough for me."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Riper had more cause for his petulancy
than he would have acknowledged even
to himself. He was a man who had kept his
shop open all through Clinton's occupancy,
and who had had no trouble with the British.
And when they were gone he had had to do
enough to clear his skirts of any smirch of
Toryism, and to implant in his own breast a
settled feeling of militant Americanism. He
did not like it that the order of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5" href="#Page_5">[5]</a></span>
should change&mdash;and the order of things was
changing. The town was growing out of all
knowledge of itself. Here they had their
Orphan Asylum, and their Botanical Garden,
and their Historical Society; and the Jews
were having it all their own way; and now
people were talking of free schools, and of laying
out a map for the upper end of the town
to grow on, in the "system" of straight streets
and avenues. To the devil with systems and
avenues! said he. That was all the doing of
those cursed Frenchmen. He knew how it
would be when they brought their plaguy
frigate here in the first fever year&mdash;'93&mdash;and
the fools marched up from Peck's Slip after a
red nightcap, and howled their cut-throat song
all night long.</p>

<p>It began to hum itself in his head as he
walked toward Water Street&mdash;<i>Ça ira&mdash;ça ira&mdash;les
aristocrats à la lanterne</i>. A whiff of the
wind that blew through Paris streets in the
terrible times had come across the Atlantic
and tickled his dull old Dutch nostrils.</p>

<p>But something worse than this vexed the
conservative spirit of Abram Van Riper. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6" href="#Page_6">[6]</a></span>
could forgive John Pintard&mdash;whose inspiration,
I think, foreran the twentieth century&mdash;his
fancy for free schools and historical societies,
as he had forgiven him his sidewalk-building
fifteen years before; he could proudly overlook
the fact that the women were busying themselves
with all manner of wild charities; he
could be contented though he knew that the
Hebrew Hart was president of that merchants'
club at Baker's, of which he himself would fain
have been a member. But there was some
thing in the air that he could neither forgive
nor overlook, nor be contented with.</p>

<p>There was a change coming over the town&mdash;a
change which he could not clearly define,
even in his own mind. There was a great
keeping of carriages, he knew. A dozen men
had bought carriages, or were likely to buy
them at any time. The women were forming
societies for the improvement of this and that.
And he, who had moved up-town from Dock
Street, was now in an old-fashioned quarter.
All this he knew, but the something which
made him uneasy was more subtile.</p>

<p>Within the last few years he had observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7" href="#Page_7">[7]</a></span>
an introduction of certain strange distinctions
in the social code of the town. It had been
vaguely intimated to him&mdash;perhaps by his
wife, he could not remember&mdash;that there was
a difference between his trade and Jacob
Dolph's trade. He was a ship-chandler. Jacob
Dolph sold timber. Their shops were
side by side; Jacob Dolph's rafts lay in the
river in front of Abram Van Riper's shop,
and Abram Van Riper had gone on Jacob
Dolph's note, only a few years ago. Yet, it
seemed that it was <i>genteel</i> of Jacob Dolph to
sell timber, and it was not genteel of Abram
Van Riper to be a ship-chandler. There was,
then, a difference between Jacob Dolph and
Abram Van Riper&mdash;a difference which, in forty
years, Abram Van Riper had never conceived
of. There were folks who held thus. For
himself, he did not understand it. What difference
there was between selling the wood to
make a ship, and selling the stores to go inside
of her, he could not understand.</p>

<p>The town was changing for the worse; he
saw that. He did not wish&mdash;God forbid!&mdash;that
his son John should go running about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8" href="#Page_8">[8]</a></span>
pleasure-gardens. But it would be no more
than neighborly if these young bucks who
went out every night should ask him to go
with them. Were William Irving's boys and
Harry Brevoort and those young Kembles too
fine to be friends with his boy? Not that he'd
go with them a-rollicking&mdash;no, not that&mdash;but
'twould be neighborly. It was all wrong, he
thought; they were going whither they knew
not, and wherefore they knew not; and with
that he cursed their airs and their graces, and
pounded down to the Tontine, to put his name
at the head of the list of those who subscribed
for a testimonial service of plate, to be presented
to our esteemed fellow-citizen and
valued associate, Jacob Dolph, on his retirement
from active business.</p>

<hr />

<p>Jacob Dolph at this moment was setting
forth from his house in State Street, whose pillared
balcony, rising from the second floor to
the roof, caught a side glance of the morning
sun, that loved the Battery far better than Pine
Street. He had his little boy by the hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9" href="#Page_9">[9]</a></span>&mdash;young
Jacob, his miniature, his heir, and the
last and only living one of his eight children.
Mr. Dolph walked with his stock thrust out
and the lower end of his waistcoat drawn in&mdash;he
was Colonel Dolph, if he had cared to keep
the title; and had come back from Monmouth
with a hole in his hip that gave him a bit of a
limp, even now in eighteen-hundred-and-seven.
He and the boy marched forth like an army
with a small but enthusiastic left wing, into the
poplar-studded Battery. The wind blew fresh
off the bay; the waves beat up against the seawall,
and swirled with a chuckle under Castle
Garden bridge. A large brig was coming up
before the wind, all her sails set, as though she
were afraid&mdash;and she was&mdash;of British frigates
outside the Hook. Two or three fat little
boats, cat-rigged, after the good old New York
fashion, were beating down toward Staten
Island, to hunt for the earliest blue-fish.</p>

<p>The two Dolphs crossed the Battery, where
the elder bowed to his friends among the merchants
who lounged about the city's pleasure-ground,
lazily chatting over their business affairs.
Then they turned up past Bowling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10" href="#Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Green into Broadway, where Mr. Dolph kept
on bowing, for half the town was out, taking
the fresh morning for marketing and all manner
of shopping. Everybody knew Jacob
Dolph afar off by his blue coat with the silver
buttons, his nankeen waistcoat, and his red-checked
Indian silk neckcloth. He made it a
sort of uniform. Captain Beare had brought
him a bolt of nankeen and a silk kerchief every
year since 1793, when Mr. Dolph gave him
credit for the timber of which the <i>Ursa Minor</i>
was built.</p>

<p>And everybody seemed willing to make acquaintance
with young Jacob's London-made
kerseymere breeches, of a bright canary color,
and with his lavender silk coat, and with his
little <i>chapeau de Paris</i>. Indeed, young Jacob
was quite the most prominent moving spectacle
on Broadway, until they came to John
Street, and saw something rolling down the
street that quite cut the yellow kerseymeres
out of all popular attention.</p>

<p>This was a carriage, the body of which was
shaped like a huge section of a cheese, set up
on its small end upon broad, swinging straps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11" href="#Page_11">[11]</a></span>
between two pairs of wheels. It was not unlike
a piece of cheese in color, for it was of a
dull and faded grayish-green, like mould, relieved
by pale-yellow panels and gilt ornaments.
It was truly an interesting structure,
and it attracted nearly as much notice on
Broadway in 1807 as it might to-day. But it
was received with far more reverence, for it
was a court coach, and it belonged to the Des
Anges family, the rich Huguenots of New
Rochelle. It had been built in France, thirty
years before, and had been sent over as a present
to his brother from the Count des Anges,
who had himself neglected to make use of his
opportunities to embrace the Protestant religion.</p>

<p>When the white-haired old lady who sat in
this coach, with a very little girl by her side,
saw Mr. Dolph and his son, she leaned out of
the window and signalled to the old periwigged
driver to stop, and he drew up close to
the sidewalk. And then Mr. Dolph and his
son came up to the window and took off their
hats, and made a great low bow and a small
low bow to the old lady and the little girl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12" href="#Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Madam Des Anges," said Mr. Dolph, with
an idiom which he had learned when he was
presented at the court of Louis the Sixteenth,
"has surely not driven down from New Rochelle
this morning? That would tax even her
powers."</p>

<p>Madam Des Anges did not smile&mdash;she had
no taste for smiling&mdash;but she bridled amiably.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Dolph," she replied; "I have been
staying with my daughter-in-law, at her house
at King's Bridge, and I have come to town to
put my little granddaughter to school. She is
to have the privilege of being a pupil of Mme.
Dumesnil."</p>

<p>Madam Des Anges indicated the little girl
with a slight movement, as though she did not
wish to allow the child more consideration than
a child deserved. The little girl turned a great
pair of awed eyes, first on her grandmother,
and then on the gentlemen, and spoke no
word. Young Jacob Dolph stared hard at
her, and then contemplated his kerseymeres
with lazy satisfaction. He had no time for
girls. And a boy who had his breeches made
in London was a boy of consequence, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" href="#Page_13">[13]</a></span>
need not concern himself about every one he
saw.</p>

<p>"And this is your son, I make no doubt,"
went on Madam Des Anges; "you must bring
him to see us at King's Bridge, while we are
so near you. These young people should
know each other."</p>

<p>Mr. Dolph said he would, and showed a becoming
sense of the honor of the invitation;
and he made young Jacob say a little speech
of thanks, which he did with a doubtful grace;
and then Mr. Dolph sent his compliments to
Madam Des Anges' daughter-in-law, and Madam
Des Anges sent her compliments to Mrs.
Dolph, and there was more stately bowing, and
the carriage lumbered on, with the little girl
looking timorously out of the window, her
great eyes fixed on the yellow kerseymeres, as
they twinkled up the street.</p>

<p>"Papa," said young Jacob, as they turned
the corner of Ann Street, "when may I go to a
boys' school? I'm monstrous big to be at Mrs.
Kilmaster's. And I don't like to be a girl-boy."</p>

<p>"Are you a girl-boy?" inquired his father,
smiling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" href="#Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aleck Cameron called me one yesterday.
He said I was a girl-boy because I went to
dame-school. He called me Missy, too!" the
boy went on, with his breast swelling.</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/ill-p014.jpg" >
<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p014-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="393" alt="" title="" />
</a>
</div>

<p>"We'll see about it," said Mr. Dolph, smiling
again; and they walked on in silence to
Mrs. Kilmaster's door, where he struck the
knocker, and a neat mulatto girl opened the
narrow door. Then he patted his boy on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15" href="#Page_15">[15]</a></span>
head and bade him good-by for the morning,
and told him to be a good boy at school. He
took a step or two and looked back. Young
Jacob lingered on the step, as if he had a further
communication to make. He paused.</p>

<p>"I thumped him," said young Jacob, and
the narrow door swallowed him up.</p>

<p>Mr. Dolph continued on his walk up Broadway.
As he passed the upper end of the Common
he looked with interest at the piles of red
sandstone among the piles of white marble,
where they were building the new City Hall.
The Council had ordered that the rear or
northward end of the edifice should be constructed
of red stone; because red stone was
cheap, and none but a few suburbans would
ever look down on it from above Chambers
Street. Mr. Dolph shook his head. He
thought he knew better. He had watched the
growth of trade; he knew the room for further
growth; he had noticed the long converging
lines of river-front, with their unbounded
accommodation for wharves and
slips. He believed that the day would come&mdash;and
his own boy might see it&mdash;when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" href="#Page_16">[16]</a></span>
business of the city would crowd the dwelling-houses
from the river side, east and west, as
far, maybe, as Chambers Street. He had no
doubt that the boy might find himself, forty
years from then, in a populous and genteel
neighborhood. Perhaps he foresaw too much;
but he had a jealous yearning for a house that
should be a home for him, and for his child,
and for his grandchildren. He wanted a place
where his wife might have a garden; a place
which the boy would grow up to love and
cherish, where the boy might bring a wife
some day. And even if it were a little out of
town&mdash;why, his wife did not want a rout every
night; and it was likely his old friends would
come out and see him once in a while, and
smoke a pipe in his garden and eat a dish of
strawberries, perhaps.</p>

<p>As he thought it all over for the hundredth
time, weighing for and against in his gentle
and deliberative mind, he strolled far out of
town. There was a house here and there on
the road&mdash;a house with a trim, stiff little garden,
full of pink and white and blue flowers in
orderly, clam-shell-bordered beds. But it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" href="#Page_17">[17]</a></span>
certainly, he had to admit, as he looked about
him, very <i>countrified</i> indeed. It seemed that
the city must lose itself if it wandered up here
among these rolling meadows and wooded
hills. Yet even up here, half way to Greenwich
Village, there were little outposts of the
town&mdash;clumps of neighborly houses, mostly
of the poorer class, huddling together to form
small nuclei for sporadic growth. There was
one on his right, near the head of Collect
Street. Perhaps that quizzical little old German
was right, who had told him that King's
Bridge property was a rational investment.</p>

<p>He went across the hill where Grand Street
crosses Broadway, and up past what was then
North and is to-day Houston Street, and then
turned down a straggling road that ran east
and west. He walked toward the Hudson, and
passed a farmhouse or two, and came to a bare
place where there were no trees, and only a
few tangled bushes and ground-vines.</p>

<p>Here a man was sitting on a stone, awaiting
him. As he came near, the man arose.</p>

<p>"Ah, it's you, Weeks? And have you the
plan?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18" href="#Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Colonel&mdash;Mr. Dolph. I've put the
window where you want it&mdash;that is, my brother
Levi did&mdash;though I don't see as you're going to
have much trouble in looking over anything
that's likely to come between you and the
river."</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/ill-p018.jpg" >
<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p018-thumb.jpg" width="343" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</a>
</div>

<p>Mr. Dolph took the crisp roll of parchment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" href="#Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and studied it with loving interest. It had
gone back to Ezra Weeks, the builder, and his
brother Levi, the architect, for the twentieth
time, perhaps. Was there ever an architect's
plan put in the hands of a happy nest-builder
where the windows did not go up and down
from day to day, and the doors did not crawl
all around the house, and the veranda did not
contract and expand like a sensitive plant; or
where the rooms and closets and corridors did
not march backward and forward and in and
out at the bidding of every fond, untutored
whim?</p>

<p>"It's a monstrous great big place for a country-house,
Mr. Dolph," said Ezra Weeks, as he
looked over Jacob Dolph's shoulder at the
drawings of the house, and shook his head with
a sort of pitying admiration for the projector's
audacity.</p>

<p>They talked for a while, and looked at the
site as if they might see more in it than they
saw yesterday, and then Weeks set off for the
city, pledged to hire laborers and to begin the
work on the morrow.</p>

<p>"I think I can get you some of that stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" href="#Page_20">[20]</a></span>
that's going into the back of the City Hall,
if you say so, Mr. Dolph. That stone was
bought cheap, you know&mdash;bought for the
city."</p>

<p>"See what you can do, Weeks," said Mr.
Dolph; and Mr. Weeks went whistling down
the road.</p>

<p>Jacob Dolph walked around his prospective
domain. He kicked a wild blackberry bush
aside, to look at the head of a stake, and tried
to realize that that would be the corner of his
house. He went to where the parlor fireplace
would be, and stared at the grass and stones,
wondering what it would be like to watch the
fire flickering on the new hearth. Then he
looked over toward the Hudson, and saw the
green woods on Union Hill and the top of a
white sail over the high river-bank. He
hoped that no one would build a large house
between him and the river.</p>

<p>He lingered so long that the smoke of midday
dinners was arising from Greenwich Village
when he turned back toward town. When he
reached the Commons on his homeward way
he came across a knot of idlers who were wasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21" href="#Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the hour of the noontide meal in gaping at
the unfinished municipal building.</p>

<p>They were admiringly critical. One man
was vociferously enthusiastic.</p>

<p>"It's a marvellous fine building, say I, sir!
Worthy of the classic shades of antiquity. If
Europe can show a finer than that will be
when she's done, then, in <i>my</i> opinion, sir,
Europe is doing well."</p>

<p>"You admire the architecture, Mr. Huggins?"
asked Mr. Dolph, coming up behind him.
Mr. Huggins turned around, slightly disconcerted,
and assumed an amiability of manner
such as can only be a professional acquirement
among us poor creatures of human nature.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Dolph&mdash;Colonel, I should say! I
have purposed to do myself the honor of presenting
myself at your house this afternoon,
Colonel Dolph, to inquire if you did not desire
to have your peruke <i>frisée</i>. For I had taken
the liberty of observing you in conversation
with Madam Des Anges this morning, in her
equipage, and it had occurred to me that possibly
the madam might be a-staying with you."</p>

<p>"Madam Des Anges does not honor my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" href="#Page_22">[22]</a></span>
house this time, Huggins," returned Mr. Dolph,
with an indulgent little laugh; "and my poor
old peruke will do very well for to-day."</p>

<p>There was a perceptible diminution in Mr.
Huggins's ardor; but he was still suave.</p>

<p>"I hope the madam is in good health," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"She is, I believe," said Mr. Dolph.</p>

<p>"And your good lady, sir? I have not had
the pleasure of treating Mrs. Dolph professionally
for some time, sir, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Dolph was wary. "I don't think Mrs.
Dolph is fond of the latest modes, Huggins.
But here comes Mr. Van Riper. Perhaps he
will have his peruke <i>frisée</i>."</p>

<p>Mr. Huggins got out of a dancing-master's
pose with intelligent alacrity, bade Mr. Dolph
a hasty "Good-afternoon!" and hurried off
toward his shop, one door above Wall Street.
Mr. Van Riper did not like "John Richard
Desbrosses Huggins, Knight of the Comb."</p>

<p>There was something else that Mr. Van
Riper did not like.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Dolph!" he hailed his friend.
"What's this I heard about you building a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23" href="#Page_23">[23]</a></span>
preposterous tom-fool of a town-house out by
Greenwich? Why don't you hire that house
that Burr had, up near Lispenard's cow-pasture,
and be done with it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Dolph seized his chance.</p>

<p>"It's not so preposterous as all that. By
the way, talking of Burr, I hear from Richmond
that he'll positively be tried next week.
Did you know that young Irving&mdash;William's
son, the youngest, the lad that writes squibs&mdash;has
gone to Richmond for the defence?"</p>

<p>"William Irving's son might be in better
business," grunted Mr. Van Riper, for a moment
diverted. "If we'd got at that devil
when he murdered poor Hamilton&mdash;'fore gad,
we'd have saved the trouble of trying him.
Do you remember when we was for going to
Philadelphia after him, and there the sly
scamp was at home all the time up in his fine
house, a-sitting in a tub of water, reading
French stuff, as cool as a cowcumber, with the
whole town hunting for him?" Then he came
back. "But that house of yours. You
haven't got this crazy notion that New York's
going to turn into London while you smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24" href="#Page_24">[24]</a></span>
your pipe, have you? You're keeping some of
your seven business senses, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Mr. Dolph mildly defended
his hobby; "there is a great potentiality of
growth in this city. Here's an estimate that
John Pintard made the other day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"John Pintard! He's another like <i>you</i>!"
said Mr. Van Riper.</p>

<p>"Well, look at it for yourself," pleaded the
believer in New York's future.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Riper took the neatly written
paper, and simply snorted and gasped as he
read this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Statistical</i>.</p>

<p>By the numeration of the inhabitants of this city, recently
published, the progress of population for the last 5 years appears
to be at the rate of 25 per cent. Should our city continue
to increase in the same proportion during the present
century, the aggregate number at its close will far exceed that

will appear from the following table. Progress of population

<p>When he had read it through he was a-quivering,
crimson with that rage of Conservative
indignation which is even more fervent than
the flames of Radical enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "there's seventy-five thousand
people in this town, and there'll be seventy-five
thousand bankrupts if this lunacy goes
on. And there's seventy-five thousand maggots
in your brain, and seventy-five thousand
in John Pintard's; and if you two live to see
nineteen hundred, you'll have twice five million
two hundred and fifty-seven thousand four
hundred and ninety-three&mdash;whatever that may
be!" And he thrust the paper back at Jacob
Dolph, and made for the Tontine and the society
of sensible men.</p>

<hr />

<p>The house was built, in spite of Abram Van
Riper's remonstrance. It had a stone front,
almost flush with the road, and brick gable-ends,
in each one of which, high up near the
roof, stood an arched window, to lift an eyebrow
to the sun, morning and evening. But it
was only a country-house, after all; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" href="#Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Dolphs set up their carriage and drove out and
in, from June to September.</p>

<p>There was a garden at the side, where Mrs.
Dolph could have the flowers her heart had
yearned after ever since Jacob Dolph brought
her from her home at Rondout, when she was
seventeen.</p>

<hr />

<p>Strengthened by the country air&mdash;so they
said&mdash;young Jacob grew clean out of his dame-school
days and into and out of Columbia College,
and was sent abroad, a sturdy youth, to
have a year's holiday. It was to the new
house that he came back the next summer,
with a wonderful stock of fine clothes and of
finer manners, and with a pair of mustaches
that scandalized everybody but Madam Des
Anges, who had seen the like in France when she
visited her brother. And a very fine young buck
was young Jacob, altogether, with his knowledge
of French and his ignorance of Dutch,
and a way he had with the women, and another
way he had with the men, and his heirship
to old Jacob Dolph's money and his two houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" href="#Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>For they stayed in the old house until 1822.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was a close, hot night in the early summer;
there was a thick, warm mist that turned
now and then into a soft rain; yet every window
in the Dolphs' house on State Street was
closed.</p>

<p>It had been a hideous day for New York.
From early morning until long after dark had
set in, the streets had been filled with frightened,
disordered crowds. The city was again
stricken with the old, inevitable, ever-recurring
scourge of yellow fever, and the people had
lost their heads. In every house, in every
office and shop, there was hasty packing, mad
confusion, and wild flight. It was only a question
of getting out of town as best one might.
Wagons and carts creaked and rumbled and
rattled through every street, piled high with
household chattels, up-heaped in blind haste.
Women rode on the swaying loads, or walked
beside with the smaller children in their arms.
Men bore heavy burdens, and children helped
according to their strength. There was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" href="#Page_28">[28]</a></span>
one idea, and that was flight&mdash;from a pestilence
whose coming might have been prevented, and
whose course could have been stayed. To
most of these poor creatures the only haven
seemed to be Greenwich Village; but some
sought the scattered settlements above; some
crossed to Hoboken; some to Bushwick; while
others made a long journey to Staten Island,
across the bay. And when they reached their
goals, it was to beg or buy lodgings anywhere
and anyhow; to sleep in cellars and garrets, in
barns and stables.</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/ill-p028.jpg" >
<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p028-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="230" alt="" title="" />
</a>
</div>

<p>The panic was not only among the poor and
ignorant. Merchants were moving their offices,
and even the Post Office and the Custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29" href="#Page_29">[29]</a></span>
House were to be transferred to Greenwich.
There were some who remained faithful
throughout all, and who labored for the
stricken, and whose names are not even written
in the memory of their fellow-men. But the
city had been so often ravaged before, that at
the first sight there was one mere animal impulse
of flight that seized upon all alike.</p>

<p>At one o'clock, when some of the better
streets had once more taken on their natural
quiet, an ox-cart stood before the door of the
Dolphs' old house. A little behind it stood
the family carriage, its lamps unlit. The
horses stirred uneasily, but the oxen waited
in dull, indifferent patience. Presently the
door opened, and two men came out and awkwardly
bore a plain coffin to the cart. Then
they mounted to the front of the cart, hiding
between them a muffled lantern. They wore
cloths over the lower part of their faces, and
felt hats drawn low over their eyes. Something
in their gait showed them to be seafaring men,
or the like.</p>

<p>Then out of the open door came Jacob
Dolph, moving with a feeble shuffle between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" href="#Page_30">[30]</a></span>
his son and his old negro coachman&mdash;this man
and his wife the only faithful of all the servants.
The young man put his father in the carriage,
and the negro went back and locked the
doors and brought the keys to his young master.
He mounted to the box, and through the darkness
could be seen a white towel tied around
his arm&mdash;the old badge of servitude's mourning.</p>

<p>The oxen were started up, and the two vehicles
moved up into Broadway. They travelled
with painful slowness; the horses had to
be held in to keep them behind the cart, for
the oxen could be only guided by the whip,
and not by word of mouth. The old man
moaned a little at the pace, and quivered when
he heard the distant sound of hammers.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked, nervously.</p>

<p>"They are boarding up some of the streets,"
said his son; "do not fear, father. Everything
is prepared; and if we make no noise, we shall
not be troubled."</p>

<p>"If we can only keep her out of the Potter's
Field&mdash;the Potter's Field!" cried the father;
"I'll thank God&mdash;I'll ask no more&mdash;I'll ask no
more!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31" href="#Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>And then he broke down and cried a little,
feebly, and got his son's hand in the darkness
and put on his own shoulder.</p>

<p>It was nearly two when they came to St.
Paul's and turned the corner to the gate. It
was dark below, but some frenzied fools were
burning tar-barrels far down Ann Street, and
the light flickered on the top of the church
spire. They crossed the churchyard to where
a shallow grave had been dug, half way down
the hill. The men lowered the body into it;
the old negro gave them a little <i>rouleau</i> of
coin, and they went hurriedly away into the
night.</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/ill-p031.jpg" >
<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p031-thumb.jpg" width="274" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</a>
</div>

<p>The clergyman came out by and by, with the
sexton behind him. He stood high up above
the grave, and drew his long cloak about him
and lifted an old pomander-box to his face.
He was not more foolish than his fellows; in
that evil hour men took to charms and to saying
of spells. Below the grave and apart, for
the curse rested upon them, too, stood Jacob
Dolph and his son, the old man leaning on the
arm of the younger. Then the clergyman began
to read the service for the burial of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32" href="#Page_32">[32]</a></span>
dead, over the departed sister&mdash;and wife and
mother. He spoke low; but his voice seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" href="#Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to echo in the stillness. He came forward with
a certain shrinking, and cast the handful of
dust and ashes into the grave. When it was
done, the sexton stepped forward and rapidly
threw in the earth until he had filled the little
hollow even with the ground. Then, with fearful
precaution, he laid down the carefully cut
sods, and smoothed them until there was no
sign of what had been done. The clergyman
turned to the two mourners, without moving
nearer to them, and lifted up his hands. The
old man tried to kneel; but his son held him
up, for he was too feeble, and they bent their
heads for a moment of silence. The clergyman
went away as he had come; and Jacob
Dolph and his son went back to the carriage.
When his father was seated, young Jacob
Dolph said to the coachman: "To the new
house."</p>

<p>The heavy coach swung into Broadway, and
climbed up the hill out into the open country.
There were lights still burning in the farmhouses,
bright gleams to east and west, but
the silence of the damp summer night hung
over the sparse suburbs, and the darkness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34" href="#Page_34">[34]</a></span>
seemed to grow more intense as they drove
away from the city. The trees by the roadside
were almost black in the gray mist; the
raw, moist smell of the night, the damp air,
chilly upon the high land, came in through the
carriage windows. Young Jacob looked out
and noted their progress by familiar landmarks
on the road; but the old man sat with his head
bent on his new black stock.</p>

<p>It was almost three, and the east was beginning
to look dark, as though a storm were settling
there in the grayness, when they turned
down the straggling street and drew up before
the great dark mass that was the new house.
The carriage-wheels gritted against the loose
stones at the edge of the roadway, and the
great door of the house swung open. The
light of one wavering candle-flame, held high
above her head, fell on the black face of old
Chloe, the coachman's wife. There were no
candles burning on the high-pitched stairway;
all was dark behind her in the empty house.</p>

<p>Young Jacob Dolph helped his father to the
ground, and between the young man and the
negro old Jacob Dolph wearily climbed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" href="#Page_35">[35]</a></span>
steps. Chloe lifted her apron to her face, and
turned to lead them up the stair. Her husband
went out to his horses, shutting the door
softly after him, between Jacob Dolph's old
life and the new life that was to begin in the
new house.</p>

<h2>II.</h2>


<p>When young Jacob Dolph came down
to breakfast the next morning he
found his father waiting for him in the breakfast-room.
The meal was upon the table.
Old Chloe stood with her black hands folded
upon her white apron, and her pathetic negro
eyes following the old gentleman as he moved
wistfully about the room.</p>

<p>Father and son shook hands in silence, and
turned to the table. There were three chairs
in their accustomed places. They hesitated a
half-second, looking at the third great arm-chair,
as though they waited for the mistress
of the house to take her place. Then they
sat down. It was six years before any one
took that third chair, but every morning
Jacob Dolph the elder made that little pause
before he put himself at the foot of the table.</p>

<p>On this first morning there was very little
said and very little eaten. But when they
had made an end of sitting at the table old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" href="#Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Jacob Dolph said, with something almost like
testiness in his husky voice:</p>

<p>"Jacob, I want to sell the house."</p>

<p>"Father!"</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/ill-p037.jpg" >
<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p037-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="376" alt="" title="" />
</a>
</div>

<p>"The old house, I mean; I shall never go
back there."</p>

<p>His son looked at him with a further inquiry.
He felt a sudden new apprehension.
The father sat back in his easy-chair, drumming
on the arms with nervous fingers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38" href="#Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall never go back there," he said again.</p>

<p>"Of course you know best, sir," said young
Jacob, gently; "but would it be well to be
precipitate? It is possible that you may feel
differently some time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no 'some time' for me!" broke
in the old man, gripping the chair-arms,
fiercely; "my time's done&mdash;done, sir!"</p>

<p>Then his voice broke and became plaintively
kind.</p>

<p>"There, there! Forgive me, Jacob, boy.
But it's true, my boy, true. The world's done,
for me; but there's a world ahead for you, my
son, thank God! I'll be patient&mdash;I'll be
patient. God has been good to me, and I
haven't many years to wait, in the course of
nature."</p>

<p>He looked vacantly out of the window, trying
to see the unforeseen with his mental
sight.</p>

<p>"While I'm here, Jacob, let the old man
have his way. It's a whimsey; I doubt 'tis
hardly rational. But I have no heart to go
home. Let me learn to live my life here.
'Twill be easier."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39" href="#Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"But do you think it necessary to sell, sir?
Could you not hold the house? Are you certain
that you would like to have a stranger
living there?"</p>

<p>"I care not a pin who lives within those
four walls now, sir!" cried the elder, with a
momentary return of his vehemence. "It's
no house to me now. Sell it, sir, sell it!&mdash;if
there's any one will give money for it at a time
like this. Bring every stick of furniture and
every stitch of carpet up here; and let me
have my way, Jacob&mdash;it won't be for long."</p>

<p>He got up and went blindly out of the
room, and his son heard him muttering, "Not
for long&mdash;not for long, now," as he wandered
about the house and went aimlessly into room
after room.</p>

<p>Old Jacob Dolph had always been an indulgent
parent, and none kinder ever lived. But
we should hardly call him indulgent to-day.
Good as he was to his boy, it had always been
with the goodness of a superior. It was the
way of his time. A half-century ago the
child's position was equivocal. He lived by
the grace of God and his parents, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40" href="#Page_40">[40]</a></span>
duty to him was rather a duty to society, born
of an abstract morality. Love was given him,
not as a right, but as an indulgence. And
young Jacob Dolph, in all his grief and anxiety,
was guiltily conscious of a secret thrill of
pleasure&mdash;natural enough, poor boy!&mdash;in his
sudden elevation to the full dignity of manhood,
and his father's abdication of the headship
of the house.</p>

<p>A little later in the day, urged again by the
old gentleman, he put on his hat and went to
see Abram Van Riper. Mr. Van Riper was
now, despite his objections to the pernicious
institution of country-houses, a near neighbor
of the Dolphs. He had yielded, not to fashion,
but to yellow fever, and at the very first of
the outbreak had bought a house on the outskirts
of Greenwich Village, and had moved
there in unseemly haste. He had also registered
an unnecessarily profane oath that he
would never again live within the city limits.</p>

<p>When young Jacob Dolph came in front of
the low, hip-roofed house, whose lower story
of undressed stone shone with fresh whitewash,
Mr. Van Riper stood on his stoop and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41" href="#Page_41">[41]</a></span>
checked his guest at the front gate, a dozen
yards away. From this distance he jabbed his
big gold-headed cane toward the young man,
as though to keep him off.</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/ill-p041.jpg" >
<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p041-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="392" alt="" title="" />
</a>
</div>

<p>"Stay there, sir&mdash;you, sir, you Jacob
Dolph!" he roared, brandishing the big stick.
"Stand back, I tell you! Don't come in, sir!
Good-day, sir&mdash;good-day, good-day, good-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42" href="#Page_42">[42]</a></span>day!"
(This hurried excursus was in deference
to a sense of social duty.) "Keep away,
confound you, keep away&mdash;consume your
body, sir, stay where you are!"</p>

<p>"I'm not coming any nearer, Mr. Van
Riper," said Jacob Dolph, with a smile which
he could not help.</p>

<p>"I can't have you in here, sir," went on Mr.
Van Riper, with no abatement of his agitation.
"I don't want to be inhospitable; but I've got
a wife and a son, sir, and you're infectious&mdash;damn
it, sir, you're infectious!"</p>

<p>"I'll stay where I am, Mr. Van Riper," said
young Jacob, smiling again. "I only came
with a message from my father."</p>

<p>"With a what?" screamed Mr. Van Riper.
"I can't have&mdash;oh, ay, a message! Well, say
it then and be off, like a sensible youngster.
Consume it, man, can't you talk farther out in
the street?"</p>

<p>When Mr. Van Riper learned his visitor's
message, he flung his stick on the white pebbles
of the clam-shell-bordered path, and swore
that he, Van Riper, was the only sane man in
a city of lunatics, and that if Jacob Dolph tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43" href="#Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to carry out his plan he should be shipped
straightway to Bloomingdale.</p>

<p>But young Jacob had something of his
father's patience, and, despite the publicity of
the interview, he contrived to make Mr. Van
Riper understand how matters stood. To tell
the truth, Van Riper grew quite sober and
manageable when he realized that his extravagant
imputation of insanity was not so wide
of the mark as it might have seemed, and that
there was a possibility that his old friend's
mind might be growing weak. He even ventured
a little way down the path and permitted
Jacob to come to the gate while they discussed
the situation.</p>

<p>"Poor old Dolph&mdash;poor old Jacob!" he
groaned. "We must keep him out of the
hands of the sharks, that we must!" He did
not see young Jacob's irrepressible smile at
this singular extension of metaphor. "He
mustn't be allowed to sell that house in open
market&mdash;never, sir! Confound it, I'll buy it
myself before I'll see him fleeced!"</p>

<p>In the end he agreed, on certain strict conditions
of precaution, to see young Jacob the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44" href="#Page_44">[44]</a></span>
next day and discuss ways and means to save
the property.</p>

<p>"Come here, sir, at ten, and I'll see you in
the sitting-room, and we'll find out what we
can do for your father&mdash;curse it, it makes me
feel bad; by gad, it does! Ten to-morrow,
then&mdash;and come fumigated, young man, don't
you forget that&mdash;come fumigated, sir!"</p>

<p>It was Van Riper who bought the property
at last. He paid eighteen thousand dollars for
it. This was much less than its value; but it
was more than any one else would have given
just at that time, and it was all that Van Riper
could afford. The transaction weighed on the
purchaser's mind, however. He had bought
the house solely out of kindness, at some momentary
inconvenience to himself; and yet it
looked as though he were taking advantage of
his friend's weakness. Abram Van Riper was
a man who cultivated a clear conscience, of a
plain, old-fashioned sort, and the necessity for
self-examination was novel and disagreeable to
him.</p>

<hr />

<p>Life lived itself out at Jacob Dolph's new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45" href="#Page_45">[45]</a></span>
house whether he liked it or not. The furniture
came up-town, and was somewhat awkwardly
disposed about its new quarters; and
in this unhomelike combination of two homes
old Mr. Dolph sat himself down to finish his
stint of life. He awoke each morning and
found that twenty-four hours of sleep and
waking lay before him, to be got through in
their regular order, just as they were lived
through by men who had an interest in living.
He went to bed every night, and crossed off
one from a tale of days of which he could not
know the length.</p>

<p>Of course his son, in some measure, saved
his existence from emptiness. He was proud
of young Jacob&mdash;fond and proud. He looked
upon him as a prince of men, which he was,
indeed. He trusted absolutely in the young
man, and his trust was well placed. And he
knew that his boy loved him. But he had an
old man's sad consciousness that he was not
necessary to Jacob&mdash;that he was an adjunct, at
the best, not an integral part of this younger
existence. He saw Jacob the younger gradually
recovering from his grief for the mother who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46" href="#Page_46">[46]</a></span>
had left them; and he knew that even so would
Jacob some day recover from grief when his
father should have gone.</p>

<p>He saw this; but it is doubtful if he felt it
acutely. Nature was gradually dulling his sensibilities
with that wonderful anæsthetic of
hers, which is so much kinder to the patient
than it is to his watching friends. After the
first wild freak of selling the house, he showed,
for a long time, no marked signs of mental impairment,
beyond his lack of interest in the
things which he had once cared about&mdash;even in
the growth of the city he loved. And in a
lonely and unoccupied man, sixty-five years of
age, this was not unnatural. It was not unnatural,
even, if now and then he was whimsical,
and took odd fancies and prejudices. But
nevertheless the work was going on within his
brain, little by little, day by day.</p>

<p>He settled his life into an almost mechanical
routine, of which the most active part was his
daily walk down into the city. At first he
would not go beyond St. Paul's churchyard;
but after awhile he began to take timorous
strolls among the old business streets where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47" href="#Page_47">[47]</a></span>
his life had been passed. He would drop into
the offices of his old friends, and would read
the market reports with a pretence of great interest,
and then he would fold up his spectacles
and put them in their worn leather case,
and walk slowly out. He was always pleased
when one of the younger clerks bowed to him
and said, "Good-day, Mr. Dolph!"</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/ill-p047.jpg" >
<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p047-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="325" alt="" title="" />
</a>
</div>

<p>It was in the fourth year of his widowhood
that he bethought himself of young Jacob's
need of a more liberal social life than he had
been leading. The boy went about enough;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" href="#Page_48">[48]</a></span>
he was a good deal of a beau, so his father
heard; and there was no desirable house in the
town that did not welcome handsome, amiable
young Dolph. But he showed no signs of taking
a wife unto himself, and in those days the
bachelor had only a provisional status in
society. He was expected to wed, and the
whole circle of his friends chorused yearly a
deeper regret for the lost sheep, as time made
that detestable thing, an "old bachelor," of
him.</p>

<p>Young Jacob was receiving many courtesies
and was making no adequate return. He felt
it himself, but he was too tender of his father's
changeless grief to urge him to open the great
empty house to their friends. The father,
however, felt that it was his duty to sacrifice
his own desire for solitude, and, when the winter
of 1825 brought home the city's wandering
children&mdash;there were not so many of the wandering
sort in 1825&mdash;he insisted that young
Jacob should give a dinner to his friends
among the gay young bachelors. That would
be a beginning; and if all went well they would
have an old maiden aunt from Philadelphia to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49" href="#Page_49">[49]</a></span>
spend the winter with them, and help them to
give the dinner parties which do not encourage
bachelorhood, but rather convert and reform
the coy celibate.</p>

<p>The news went rapidly through the town.
The Dolph hospitality had been famous, and
this was taken for a signal that the Dolph
doors were to open again. There was great
excitement in Hudson Street and St. John's
Park. Maidens, bending over their tambour-frames,
working secret hopes and aspirations
in with their blossoming silks and worsted,
blushed, with faint speculative smiles, as
they thought of the vast social possibilities
of the mistress of the grand Dolph house.
Young bachelors, and old bachelors, too, rolled
memories of the Dolph Madeira over longing
tongues.</p>

<p>The Dolph cellar, too, had been famous, and
just at that period New Yorkers had a fine and
fanciful taste in wine, if they had any self-respect
whatever.</p>

<p>I think it must have been about then that
Mr. Dominick Lynch began his missionary
labors among the smokers and drinkers of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" href="#Page_50">[50]</a></span>
city; he who bought a vineyard in France and
the Vuelta Abajo plantations in Cuba, solely
to teach the people of his beloved New York
what was the positively proper thing in wines
and cigars. If it was not then, it could not
have been much later that Mr. Dolph had got
accustomed to receiving, every now and then,
an unordered and unexpected consignment of
wines or Havana cigars, sent up from Little
Dock Street&mdash;or what we call Water Street
now, the lower end of it. And I am sure that
he paid Mr. Lynch's bill with glowing pride;
for Mr. Lynch extended the evangelizing hand
of culture to none but those of pre-eminent
social position.</p>

<p>It was to be quite a large dinner; but it was
noticeable that none of the young men who
were invited had engagements of regrettable
priority.</p>

<p>Jacob Dolph the elder looked more interested
in life than he had looked in four years
when he stood on the hearthrug in the drawing-room
and received his son's guests. He
was a bold figure among all the young men,
not only because he was tall and white-haired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51" href="#Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and for the moment erect, and of a noble and
gracious cast of countenance, but because he
clung to his old style of dress&mdash;his knee-breeches
and silk stockings, and his long coat,
black, for this great occasion, but of the "shadbelly"
pattern. He wore his high black stock,
too, and his snow-white hair was gathered behind
into a loose peruke.</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/ill-p051.jpg" >
<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p051-thumb.jpg" width="315" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</a>
</div>

<p>The young men wore trousers, or pantaloons,
as they mostly called them, strapped under
their varnished boots. Their coats were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52" href="#Page_52">[52]</a></span>
cut like our dress-coats, if you can fancy them
with a wild amplitude of collar and lapel.
They wore large cravats and gaudy waistcoats,
and two or three of them who had been too
much in England came with shawls or rugs
around their shoulders.</p>

<p>They were a fashionable lot of people, and
this was a late dinner, so they sat down at
six o'clock in the great dining-room&mdash;not the
little breakfast-room&mdash;with old Jacob Dolph at
one end of the table and young Jacob Dolph
at the other.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant dinner, and the wine was
good, and the company duly appreciative,
although individually critical.</p>

<p>Old Jacob Dolph had on his right an agreeable
French count, just arrived in New York,
who was creating a <i>furor</i>; and on his left was
Mr. Philip Waters, the oldest of the young
men, who, being thirty-five, had a certain consideration
for old age. But old Jacob Dolph
was not quite at his ease. He did not understand
the remarkable decorum of the young
men. He himself belonged to the age of
"bumpers and no heel taps," and nobody at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" href="#Page_53">[53]</a></span>
his board to-night seemed to care about drinking
bumpers, even out of the poor, little, newfangled
claret-glasses, that held only a thimbleful
apiece. He had never known a lot of gentlemen,
all by themselves, to be so discreet.
Before the evening was over he became aware
of the fact that he was the only man who was
proposing toasts, and then he proposed them
no more.</p>

<p>Things had changed since he was a young
buck, and gave bachelor parties. Why, he
could remember seeing his own good father&mdash;an
irreproachable gentleman, surely&mdash;lock the
door of his dining-room on the inside&mdash;ay, at
just such a dinner as this&mdash;and swear that no
guest of his should go out of that room sober.
And his word had been kept. Times were
changing. He thought, somehow, that these
young men needed more good port in their
veins.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the festivities he grew silent.
He gave no more toasts, and drank no
more bumpers, although he might safely have
put another bottle or two under his broad
waistcoat. But he leaned back in his chair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" href="#Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and rested one hand on the table, playing
with his wineglass in an absent-minded way.
There was a vague smile on his face; but
every now and then he knit his heavy gray
brows as if he were trying to work out some
problem of memory. Mr. Philip Waters and
the French count were talking across him;
he had been in the conversation, but he had
dropped out some time before. At last he
rose, with his brows knit, and pulled out his
huge watch, and looked at its face. Everybody
turned toward him, and, at the other end
of the table, his son half rose to his feet. He
put the watch back in his pocket, and said, in
his clear, deep voice: "Gentlemen, I think we
will rejoin the ladies."</p>

<p>There was a little impulsive stir around the
table, and then he seemed to understand that
he had wandered, and a frightened look came
over his face. He tottered backward, and
swayed from side to side. Mr. Philip Waters
and the Frenchman had their arms behind
him before he could fall, and in a second or two
he had straightened himself up. He made a
stately, tremulous apology for what he called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" href="#Page_55">[55]</a></span>
his "infelicitous absence of mind," and then he
marched off to bed by himself, suffering no one
to go with him.</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/ill-p055.jpg" >
<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p055-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="261" alt="And then he marched off to bed by himself, suffering no one to go with him." title="" />
</a><p class="caption">And then he marched off to bed by himself, suffering no one to go with him.</p>
</div>

<p>A little while later in the evening, Mr.
Philip Waters, walking down Broadway (which
thoroughfare was getting to have a fairly suburban
look), informed the French count that
in his, Mr. Waters's, opinion, young Jacob
Dolph would own that house before long.</p>

<p>Young Jacob Dolph's father insisted on repetitions
of the bachelor dinner, but he never
again appeared in the great dining-room.
When there was a stag party he took his own
simple dinner at five o'clock and went to bed
early, and lay awake until his son had dismissed
the last mild reveller, and he could hear
the light, firm, young footstep mounting the
stairs to the bedroom door opposite his own.</p>

<hr />

<p>That was practically the end of it for old
Jacob Dolph. The maiden aunt, who had
been invited, was notified that she could not
come, for Mr. Dolph was not well enough to
open his house that winter. But it was delicately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56" href="#Page_56">[56]</a></span>
intimated to her that if he grew worse
she might still be sent for, and that alleviated
her natural disappointment. She liked to give
parties; but there is also a chastened joy for
some people in being at the head of a house of
mourning.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Dolph grew no worse physically, except
that he was inclined to make his daily walks
shorter, and that he grew fonder of sitting at
home in the little breakfast-room, where the sun
shone almost all day long, and where Mrs. Dolph
had once been fond of coming to sew. Her little
square work-table of mahogany stood there
still. There the old gentleman liked to dine,
and often he dined alone. Young Jacob was in
great demand all over town, and his father
knew that he ought to go out and amuse himself.
And the young man, although he was
kind and loving, and never negligent in any
office of respect or affection, had that strong
youth in him which makes it impossible to sit
every day of the week opposite an old man
whose world had slipped by him, who knew
nothing of youth except to love it and wonder
at it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" href="#Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning, before he went out for his
daily tramp into town, old Jacob would say to
young Jacob:</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall see you at dinner, my
boy?"</p>

<p>And young Jacob would say, "Yes, sir," or
"No, sir, I think not. Mrs. Des Anges was in
town yesterday, and she asked me to ride up
there to-day and dine. And Diana" (Diana
was his big black mare) "needs a little work;
she's getting badly out of condition. So,
if it doesn't matter to you, sir, I'll just
run up there and get back before the moon
sets."</p>

<p>And the father would answer that it didn't
matter, and would send his best respects,
through Mrs. Des Anges at King's Bridge, to
Madam Des Anges at New Rochelle; and at
night he would sit down alone to his dinner in
the breakfast-room, served by old Chloe, who
did her humble best to tempt his appetite,
which was likely to be feeble when Master
Jacob was away.</p>

<p>Master Jacob had taken to riding to King's
Bridge of late. Sometimes he would start out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" href="#Page_58">[58]</a></span>
early in the morning, just about the time
when young Van Riper was plodding by on
his way to the shop. Young Van Riper liked
to be at the shop an hour earlier than his
father. Old Mr. Dolph was always up, on
these occasions, to see his son start off. He
loved to look at the boy, in his English riding-boots
and breeches, astride of black Diana,
who pranced and curvetted up the unpaved
road. Young Jacob had her well in hand, but
he gave her her head and let her play until
they reached Broadway, where he made her
strike a rattling regular pace until they got
well up the road; and then she might walk
up Bloomingdale way or across to Hickory
Lane.</p>

<p>If he went up by the east he was likely to
dismount at a place which you can see now,
a little west and south of McComb's Dam
Bridge, where there is a bit of a rocky hollow,
and a sort of horizontal cleft in the rocks that
has been called a cave, and a water-washed
stone above, whose oddly shaped depression is
called an Indian's footprint. He would stop
there, because right in that hollow, as I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59" href="#Page_59">[59]</a></span>
tell you myself, grew, in his time as in mine,
the first of the spring flowers. It was full of
violets once, carpeted fairly with the pale, delicate
petals.</p>

<p>And up toward the west, on a bridle-path
between the hills and the river, as you came
toward Fort Washington, going to Tubby
Hook&mdash;we are refined nowadays, and Tubby
Hook is "Inwood"&mdash;Heaven help it!&mdash;there
were wonderful flowers in the woods. The
wind-flowers came there early, nestling under
the gray rocks that sparkled with garnets; and
there bloomed great bunches of Dutchman's-breeches&mdash;not
the thin sprays that come in
the late New England spring, but huge clumps
that two men could not enclose with linked
hands; great masses of scarlet and purple, and&mdash;mostly&mdash;of
a waxy white, with something
deathlike in their translucent beauty. There,
also, he would wade into the swamps around a
certain little creek, lured by a hope of the
jack-in-the-pulpit, to find only the odorous and
disappointing skunk-cabbage. And there the
woods were full of the aroma of sassafras, and
of birch tapped by the earliest woodpecker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60" href="#Page_60">[60]</a></span>
whose drumming throbbed through the young
man's deep and tender musing.</p>

<p>And&mdash;strange enough for a young man who
rides only to exercise his black mare&mdash;he never
came out of those woods without an armful of
columbine or the like. And&mdash;strange enough
for any young man in this world of strange
things&mdash;when he sat down at the table of Mrs.
Des Anges, in her pleasant house near Harlem
Creek, Miss Aline Des Anges wore a bunch of
those columbines at her throat. Miss Aline
Des Anges was a slim girl, not very tall, with
great dark eyes that followed some people with
a patient wistfulness.</p>

<hr />

<p>One afternoon, in May of 1827, young Jacob
found his father in the breakfast-room, and said
to him:</p>

<p>"Father, I am going to marry Aline Des
Anges."</p>

<p>His father, who had been dozing in the sun
by the south window, raised his eyes to his
son's face with a kindly, blank look, and said,
thoughtfully:</p>

<p>"Des Anges. That's a good family, Jacob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" href="#Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and a wonderful woman, Madam Des Anges.
Is she alive yet?"</p>

<hr />

<p>When Madam Des Anges, eighty years old,
and strong and well, heard of this, she said:</p>

<p>"It is the etiquette of France that one family
should make the proposition to the other
family. Under the circumstances <i>I</i> will be the
family that proposes. I will make a precedent.
The Des Anges make precedents."</p>

<p>And she rode down to the Dolph house in
the family carriage&mdash;the last time it ever went
out&mdash;and made her "proposition" to Jacob
Dolph the elder, and he brightened up most
wonderfully, until you would have thought
him quite his old self, and he told her what an
honor he esteemed the alliance, and paid her
compliments a hundred words long.</p>

<p>And in May of the next year, King's Bridge
being out of the question, and etiquette being
waived at the universal demand of society, the
young couple stood up in the drawing-room of
the Dolph house to be wed.</p>

<p>The ceremony was fashionably late&mdash;seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" href="#Page_62">[62]</a></span>
o'clock in the evening. And after it was over,
and the young couple had digested what St.
Paul had to say about the ordinance of wedlock,
and had inaudibly promised to do and be
whatever the domine required of them, they
were led by the half-dozen groomsmen to the
long glass between the front windows, and
made to stand up there, with their faces toward
the company, and to receive the congratulations
of a mighty procession of friends, who
all used the same formulas, except the very
old ones, who were delicately indelicate.</p>

<p>The bridegroom wore a blue coat and trousers,
and a white satin waistcoat embroidered
with silver-thread roses and lilies-of-the-valley.
The coat was lined with cream-colored satin,
quilted in a most elaborate pattern; and his
necktie was of satin, too, with embroidered
ends. His shirt was a miracle of fine linen.
As to the bride, she was in white satin and
lace, and at her throat she wore a little bunch
of late white columbines, for which Mr. Jacob
Dolph the younger had scoured the woods
near Fort Washington.</p>

<p>There was to be a grand supper, later; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63" href="#Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the time of waiting was filled up with fashionable
conversation.</p>

<p>That dear old doctor, who was then a dear
young doctor, and whose fine snow-crowned
face stood in later years as an outward and
visible sign of all that was brave, kindly, self-sacrificing,
and benevolent in the art of healing,
was seated by Madam Des Anges, and was
telling her, in stately phrase, suited to his
auditor, of a certain case of heroism with which
he had met in the course of his practice. Mr.
Blank, it appeared, had been bitten by a dog
that was supposed to be possessed by the rabies.
For months he had suffered the agonies
of mental suspense and of repeated cauterizing
of the flesh, and during those months had concealed
his case from his wife, that he might
spare her pain&mdash;suffering in silence enough to
unnerve most men.</p>

<p>"It was heroic," said Dr. F.</p>

<p>Madam Des Anges bowed her gray head approvingly.</p>

<p>"I think," she said, "his conduct shows him
to be a man of taste. Had he informed his
wife of his condition, she might have experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" href="#Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the most annoying solicitude; and I am
informed that she is a person of feeble character."</p>

<p>The doctor looked at her, and then down at
the floor; and then he asked her if she did not
hope that Almaviva Lynch would bring Garcia
back again, with that marvellous Italian opera,
which, as he justly observed, captivated the
eye, charmed the ear, and awakened the profoundest
emotions of the heart.</p>

<p>And at that Madam Des Anges showed
some animation, and responded that she had
listened to some pleasing operas in Paris; but
she did not know that they were of Italian origin.</p>

<p>But if Madam Des Anges was surprised to
learn that any good thing could come out of
any other country than France, there was another
surprise in store for her, and it did not
long impend.</p>

<p>It was only a little while after this that her
grandson-in-law, finding her on his right and
Abram Van Riper on his left&mdash;he had served
out his time as a statue in front of the mirror&mdash;thought
it proper to introduce to Madam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65" href="#Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Des Anges his father's old friend, Mr. Van
Riper. Mr. Van Riper bowed as low as his
waistcoat would allow, and courteously observed
that the honor then accorded him he
had enjoyed earlier in the evening through the
kind offices of Mr. Jacob Dolph, senior.</p>

<p>Madam Des Anges dandled her quizzing-glass
as though she meant to put it up to her
eye, and said, in a weary way:</p>

<p>"Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;Van Riper must pardon me. I
have not the power of remembering faces that
some people appear to have; and my eyes&mdash;my
eyes are not strong."</p>

<p>Old Van Riper stared at her, and he turned
a turkey-cock purple all over his face, down to
the double chin that hung over his white neckerchief.</p>

<p>"If your ladyship has to buy spectacles," he
sputtered, "it needn't be on my account."</p>

<p>And he stamped off to the sideboard and
tried to cool his red-hot rage with potations
of Jamaica rum. There his wife found him.
She had drawn near when she saw him talking
with the great Madam Des Anges, and she
had heard, as she stood hard by and smiled unobtrusively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" href="#Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the end of that brief conversation.
Her face, too, was flushed&mdash;a more fiery red
than her flame-colored satin dress.</p>

<p>She attacked him in a vehement whisper.</p>

<p>"Van Riper, what are you doing? I'd almost
believe you'd had too much liquor, if I
didn't know you hadn't had a drop. Will you
ever learn what gentility is? D'ye want us to
live and die like toads in a hole? Here you
are with your ill manners, offending Madam
Des Anges, that everybody knows is the best
of the best, and there's an end of all likelihood
of ever seeing her and her folks, and two nieces
unmarried and as good girls as ever was, and
such a connection for your son, who hasn't
been out of the house it's now twelve months&mdash;except
to this very wedding here, and you've
no thought of your family when once you lose
that mighty fine temper of yours, that you're
so prodigious proud of; and where you'll end
us, Van Riper, is more than I know, I vow."</p>

<p>But all she could get out of Van Riper was:</p>

<p>"The old harridan! She'll remember my
name this year or two to come, I'll warrant ye!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67" href="#Page_67">[67]</a></span></p><hr />

<p>It was all over at last, and old black Julius,
who had been acting as a combination of link-boy
and major-domo at the foot of the front
steps, extinguished his lantern, and went to
bed, some time before a little white figure
stole up the stairs and slipped into a door
that Chloe&mdash;black Chloe&mdash;held open.</p>

<p>And the next day Jacob Dolph the elder
handed the young bride into the new travelling-carriage
with his stateliest grace, and Mr.
and Mrs. Jacob Dolph, junior, rolled proudly
up the road, through Bloomingdale, and across
King's Bridge&mdash;stopping for luncheon at the
Des Anges house&mdash;over to New Rochelle,
where the feminine head of the house of Des
Anges received them at her broad front door,
and where they had the largest room in her
large, old-fashioned house, for one night.
Madam Des Anges wished to keep them
longer, and was authoritative about it. But
young Jacob settled the question of supremacy
then and there, with the utmost courtesy,
and Madam Des Anges, being great enough to
know that she was beaten, sent off the victor
on the morrow, with his trembling accomplice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68" href="#Page_68">[68]</a></span>
by his side, and wished them <i>bon voyage</i> as
heartily as she possibly could.</p>

<p>So they started afresh on their bridal tour,
and very soon the travelling carriage struck the
old Queen Anne's Road, and reached Yonkers.
And there, and from there up to Fishkill, they
passed from one country-house to another,
bright particular stars at this dinner and at
that supper, staying a day here and a night
there, and having just the sort of sociable,
public, restless, rattling good time that neither
of them wanted.</p>

<p>At every country-house where they stayed a
day they were pressed to stay a week, and always
the whole neighborhood was routed out
to pay them social tribute. The neighbors
came in by all manner of conveyances. One
family of aristocrats started at six o'clock in
the morning, and travelled fourteen miles
down the river in an ox-cart, the ladies sitting
bolt upright, with their hair elaborately
dressed for the evening's entertainment. And
once a regular assembly ball was given in their
honor, at a town-hall, the use of which was
granted for the purpose specified by unanimous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69" href="#Page_69">[69]</a></span>
vote of the town council. Of course,
they had a very good time; but then there
are various sorts of good times. Perhaps they
might have selected another sort for themselves.</p>

<p>There is a story that, on their way back,
they put up for several days at a poor little
hostelry under the hills below Peekskill, and
spent their time in wandering through the
woods and picking wild-flowers; but it lacks
confirmation, and I should be sorry to believe
that two well-brought-up young people would
prefer their own society to the unlimited hospitality
of their friends in the country.</p>

<p>Old Jacob Dolph, at home, had the great
house all to himself; and, although black
Chloe took excellent care of his material comforts,
he was restless and troubled. He took
most pleasure in a London almanac, on whose
smudgy pages he checked off the days. Letters
came as often as the steamboat arrived
from Albany, and he read them, after his fashion.
It took him half the week to get through
one missive, and by that time another had arrived.
But I fear he did not make much out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70" href="#Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of them. Still, they gave him one pleasure.
He endorsed them carefully with the name of
the writer, and the date of receipt, and then he
laid them away in his desk, as neatly as he had
filed his business letters in his old days of active
life.</p>

<p>Every night he had a candle alight in the
hallway; and if there were a far-off rumble of
carriage-wheels late at night, he would rise
from his bed&mdash;he was a light sleeper, in his age&mdash;and
steal out into the corridor, hugging his
dressing-robe about him, to peer anxiously
down over the balusters till the last sound and
the last faint hope of his son's return had died
away.</p>

<p>And, indeed, it was late in July when the
travelling-carriage once more drew up in front
of the Dolph house, and old Julius opened the
door, and old Mr. Dolph welcomed them, and
told them that he had been very lonely in their
absence, and that their mother&mdash;and then he
remembered that their mother was dead, and
went into the house with his head bowed low.</p>

<h2>III.</h2>


<p>St. John's Park and Hudson Street and
all well-bred New York, for that matter,
had its fill of the Dolph hospitality the next
winter. It was dinner and ball and rout and
merry-making of one sort or another, the season
through. The great family sleighs and the
little bachelor sleighs whirred and jingled up
to the Dolph door surely two, and sometimes
four, evenings in every week, and whirred and
jingled away again at intensely fashionable
hours, such as plain folk used for sleeping.</p>

<p>They woke up Abram Van Riper, did the revellers
northward bound to country houses on
the river-side, and, lying deep in his feather-bed,
he directed his rumbling imprecations at
the panes of glass, that sparkled with frost in
the mild moonlight.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, come, maidens, come, o'er the blue, rolling wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lovely should still be the care of the brave&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trancadillo, trancadillo, trancadillo, dillo, dillo, dillo!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72" href="#Page_72">[72]</a></span>sang the misguided slaves of fashion, as they
sped out of hearing.</p>

<p>"Trancadillo!" rumbled Mr. Van Riper.
"I'd like to trancadillo them, consume 'em!"
and then he cursed his old friend's social circle
for a parcel of trumpery fools; and Mrs. Van
Riper, lying by his side, sighed softly with
chastened regret and hopeless aspiration.</p>

<p>But everybody else&mdash;everybody who was
anybody&mdash;blessed the Dolphs and the Dolphs'
cellar, and their man-servant and their maid-servant,
and their roasted ox and their saddle
of venison, and the distinguished stranger who
was within their gates; and young Mrs. Dolph
was made as welcome as she made others.</p>

<p>For the little girl with the great dark eyes
took to all this giddiness as naturally as possible&mdash;after
her quiet fashion. The dark eyes
sparkled with subdued pleasure that had no
mean pride in it when she sat at the head of
her great mahogany table, and smiled at the
double row of bright faces that hemmed in the
gorgeous display of the Dolph silver and china
and fine linen. And it was wonderful how
charming were the famous Des Anges manners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73" href="#Page_73">[73]</a></span>
when they were softened and sweetened
by so much grace and beauty.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought she had it in
her?" said the young ladies down in St. John's
Park. "You remember her, don't you, what a
shy little slip of a thing she was when we were
at old Dumesnil's together? Who was it used
to say that she had had the life grandmothered
out of her?"</p>

<p>"Fine little creature, that wife of Dolph's,"
said the young men as they strolled about in
Niblo's Garden. "Dolph wouldn't have had
the road all to himself if that old dragon of a
grandmother had given the girl half a chance.
'Gad, she's an old grenadier! They say that
Dolph had to put her through her facings the
day after he was married, and that he did it
in uncommon fine style, too."</p>

<p>"He's a lucky devil, that Dolph," the
younger ones would sigh. "Nothing to do,
all the money he wants, pretty wife, and the
best wine in New York! I wish <i>my</i> old man
would cut the shop and try to get an education
in wine."</p>

<p>Their devotion to the frivolities of fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" href="#Page_74">[74]</a></span>
notwithstanding, the young Dolphs were a loving,
and, in a way, a domestic couple. Of
course, everybody they knew had to give them
a dinner or a ball, or pay them some such social
tribute, and there were a myriad calls to
be received and returned; but they found time
for retired communings, even for long drives
in the sleigh which, many a time in young
Jacob Dolph's bachelor days, had borne the
young man and a female companion&mdash;not always
the same companion, either&mdash;up the
Bloomingdale Road. And in the confidences
of those early days young Jacob learned what
his gentle little wife told him&mdash;without herself
realizing the pathos of it&mdash;the story of her
crushed, unchildlike youth, loveless till he
came, her prince, her deliverer. Dolph understood
it; he had known, of course, that she
could not have been happy under the <i>régime</i>
of Madam Des Anges; but when he heard the
simple tale in all its monotonous detail, and
saw spread out before him this poor young
life, with its thousand little disappointments,
submissions, abnegations, and undeserved punishments
and needless restrictions, a generous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" href="#Page_75">[75]</a></span>
rage glowed in his heart, and perhaps sprang
once in a while to his indiscreet lips; and out
of this grew a deeper and maturer tenderness
than his honeymoon love for the sweet little
soul that he had at first sought only for the
dark eyes through which it looked out upon
its joyless world.</p>

<p>It is unwise to speak in profane language, it
is injudicious to speak disrespectfully of old
age, yet the Recording Angel, if he did not see
fit to let a tear fall upon the page, perchance
found it convenient to be mending his pen
when young Jacob Dolph once uttered certain
words that made his wife cry out:</p>

<p>"Oh, Jacob, don't, <i>please</i> don't. She didn't
mean it!"</p>

<p>This is only a supposition. Perhaps Madam
Des Anges really had meant well. But oh,
how much happier this world would be if all
the people who "mean well" and do ill would
only take to meaning ill and doing well!</p>

<hr />

<p>Jacob Dolph the elder took but a doubtful
part in all the festivities. The cloud that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76" href="#Page_76">[76]</a></span>
hung dimly over him had begun to show little
rifts; but the dark masses between the rifts
were thicker and heavier than ever. It was
the last brief convulsive struggle of the patient
against the power of the anæsthetic, when the
nervous hand goes up to put the cloth away
from the mouth, just before the work is done
and consciousness slips utterly away, and life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" href="#Page_77">[77]</a></span>
is no more for the sufferer, though his heart
beat and the breath be warm between his
lips.</p>

<p>When he was bright he was almost like his
old self, and these delusive periods came oftenest
when he met some old friend, or in quiet
morning hours when his daughter&mdash;so he always
called her&mdash;sat at his feet in the sunny
breakfast-room, and sewed and listened, or perhaps
read to him from Scott's latest novel.</p>

<div class="center">

<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p077-thumb.jpg" width="362" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</a></div>

<p>He may have had some faint sub-consciousness
of his condition, for although he took the
deepest interest in the balls and the dinners,
he would never appear before his son's guests
except when he was at his best and brightest.
But he loved to sit, withdrawn in a corner,
watching the young life that fluttered through
the great rooms, smiling to himself, and gently
pleased if some old crony sought him out and
talked of old times&mdash;the older the times were,
the better he remembered them. Indeed, he
now recalled some things that he had not
thought of since his far-off boyhood.</p>

<p>In truth, the younger Dolphs often had
small heart in their festal doings. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78" href="#Page_78">[78]</a></span>
medical science of the day, positive, self-satisfied,
and blinded by all manner of tradition,
gave them, through its ministers, cruelly false
hopes of the old man's ultimate recovery.
Besides, they could not well order things otherwise.
The extravagant hospitality of the day
demanded such ceremonial, and to have abated
any part of it would only have served to grieve
and to alarm the object of their care.</p>

<p>The whole business was a constant pride and
joy to old Mr. Jacob Dolph. When there was
a dinner to be given, he would follow Aline as
she went about the house superintending the
preparations of her servants, in her flowered
apron of black silk, with her bunch of keys&mdash;honest
keys, those, a good four inches long,
with tongues as big as a domino&mdash;jingling at
her side. He would himself overlook the making
ready of the wines, and give oft-repeated
instructions as to the proper temperature for
the port, and see that the champagne was put
on ice in the huge octagonal cellaret in the
dining-room corner. And when all was ready,
as like as not he would kiss Aline on the forehead,
and say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" href="#Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have a headache to-night, my dear, and
I think I shall take my dinner in my room."</p>

<p>And he would go feebly up stairs, and when
old Julius, who always waited upon him,
brought up his tray, he would ask:</p>

<p>"Is it a fine dinner, Julius? Did everybody
come?"</p>

<p>And Julius would invariably reply, with profound
African dignity:</p>

<p>"Mons'us gran' dinneh, seh! 'E fines' dinneh
I eveh witness', seh! I have stood behin'
you' chai', seh, this thutty y'ah, an' I neveh see

<p>"Except the dinner we gave Mr. Hamilton; in
State Street, Julius," the old man would put in.</p>

<p>"<i>Ex</i>cep' that, seh," Julius would gravely
reply: "<i>that</i> was a pol-litical dinneh, seh; an',

pause&mdash;"but this he' is sho'ly a mons'us fine

<p>His bodily vigor was unimpaired, however,
and except that his times of entire mental
clearness grew fewer and briefer as the months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" href="#Page_80">[80]</a></span>
went on, there was little change in the old gentleman
when the spring of 1829 came. He
was not insane, he was not idiotic, even at the
worst. It seemed to be simply a premature
old age that clouded his faculties. He forgot
many things, he was weakly absent-minded,
often he did not recognize a familiar face, and he
seemed ever more and more disinclined to think
and to talk. He liked best to sit in silence,
seemingly unconscious of the world about him;
and if he was aroused from his dreamy trance,
his wandering speech would show that his last
thought&mdash;and it might have entered his mind
hours before, at the suggestion of some special
event&mdash;was so far back in the past that it dealt
with matters beyond his son's knowledge.</p>

<p>He was allowed to do as he pleased, for in
the common affairs of daily life he seemed to
be able to care for himself, and he plaintively
resented anything that looked like guardianship.
So he kept up his custom of walking
down into the city, at least as far as St. Paul's.
It was thought to be safe enough, for he was
a familiar figure in the town, and had friends
at every turn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81" href="#Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>But one afternoon he did not return in time
for dinner. Young Jacob was out for his afternoon
ride, which that day had taken him in
the direction of the good doctor's house. And
when he had reached the house, he found the
doctor likewise mounted for a ride. The doctor
was going up to Bond Street&mdash;the Dolphs'
quarter was growing fashionable already&mdash;to
look at a house near Broadway that he had
some thoughts of buying, for he was to be
married the coming winter. So they had ridden
back together, and after a long examination
of the house, young Jacob had ridden off
for a gallop through the country lanes; and it
was five o'clock, and dinner was on the table,
when he came to his father's house and
learned from tearful Aline that his father was
missing.</p>

<p>The horse was at the stable door when young
Jacob mounted him once more and galloped
off to Bond Street, where he found the doctor
just ready to turn down the Bowery; and they
joined forces and hurried back, and down
Broadway, inquiring of the people who sat on
their front stoops&mdash;it was a late spring evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82" href="#Page_82">[82]</a></span>
warm and fair&mdash;if they had seen old Mr.
Dolph that day.</p>

<p>Many had seen him as he went down; but
no one could remember that the old gentleman
had come back over his accustomed <ins class="correction" id="Note_1" title="Transcriber's note: period inserted">path.</ins> At
St. Paul's, the sexton thought that Mr. Dolph
had prolonged his walk down the street. Further
on, some boys had seen him, still going
southward. The searchers stopped at one or
two of the houses where he might have called;
but there was no trace of him. It was long
since old Jacob Dolph had made a formal call.</p>

<p>But at Bowling Green they were hailed by
Mr. Philip Waters, who came toward them
with more excitement in his mien than a
young man of good society often exhibited.</p>

<p>"I was going for a carriage, Dolph," he
said: "your father is down there in the Battery
Park, and I'm afraid&mdash;I'm afraid he's had
a stroke of paralysis."</p>

<p>They hurried down, and found him lying on
the grass, his head on the lap of a dark-skinned,
ear-ringed Spanish sailor. He had been seen
to fall from the bench near by, another maritime
man in the crowd about him explained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83" href="#Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was only a minit or two ago," said the
honest seafarer, swelled with the importance
that belongs to the narrator of a tale of accident
and disaster. "He was a-settin' there,
had been for two hours 'most, just a-starin' at
them houses over there, and all of a sudden
chuck forward he went, right on his face. And
then a man come along that knowed him, and
said he'd go for a kerridge, or I'd 'a' took
him on my sloop&mdash;she's a-layin' here now, with
onions from Weathersfield&mdash;and treated him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84" href="#Page_84">[84]</a></span>
well; I see he wa'n't no disrespectable character.
Here, Pedro, them's the old man's folks&mdash;let
'em take him. A-settin' there nigh on
two hours, he was, just a-studyin' them
houses. B'long near here?"</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/ill-p084.jpg" >

</a></div>

<p>Young Jacob had no words for the Connecticut
captain. Waters had arrived, with somebody's
carriage, confiscated on the highway,
and they gently lifted up the old gentleman
and set off homeward. They were just in time,
for Waters had been the earliest of the evening
promenaders to reach the Battery. It was
dinner hour&mdash;or supper hour for many&mdash;and
the park was given up to the lounging sailors
from the river-side streets.</p>

<p>The doctor's face was dark.</p>

<p>"No, it is not paralysis," he said. "Let us
proceed at once to your own home, Mr. Dolph.
In view of what I am now inclined to consider
his condition, I think it would be the most advisable
course."</p>

<p>He was as precise and exact in his speech,
even then, as he was later on, when years had
given an innocent, genial pomposity to his delivery
of his rounded sentences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85" href="#Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>They put old Jacob Dolph to bed in the
room which he had always occupied, in his
married as in his widowed days. He never
spoke again; that day, indeed, he hardly
moved. But on the next he stirred uneasily,
as though he were striving to change his position.
The doctor bled him, and they shifted
him as best they could, but he seemed no
more comfortable. So the doctor bled him
again; and even that did no good.</p>

<p>About sunset, Aline, who had watched over
him with hardly a moment's rest, left the room
for a quarter of an hour, to listen to what the
doctors had to say&mdash;there were four of them
in the drawing-room below. When she and
her husband entered the sick-room again, the
old man had moved in his bed. He was lying
on his side, his face to the windows that
looked southward, and he had raised himself a
little on his arm. There was a troubled gaze
in his eyes, as of one who strains to see something
that is unaccountably missing from his
sight. He turned his head a little, as though
to listen. Thus gazing, with an inward and
spiritual vision only, at the bay that his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86" href="#Page_86">[86]</a></span>
might never again see, and listening to the
waves whose cadence he should hear no more,
the troubled look faded into one of inscrutable
peace, and he sank back into the hollow of his
son's arm and passed away.</p>

<hr />

<p>The next time that the doctor was in the
house it was of a snowy night a few days after
New Year's Day. It was half-past two o'clock
in the morning, and Jacob Dolph&mdash;no longer
Jacob Dolph the younger&mdash;had been pacing
furiously up and down the long dining-room&mdash;that
being the longest room in the house&mdash;when
the doctor came down stairs, and addressed
him with his usual unruffled precision:</p>

<p>"I will request of you, Dolph, a large glass
of port. I need not suggest to you that it is
unnecessary to stint the measure, for the hospitality
of this house is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How is she, doctor? For God's sake, tell
me&mdash;is she&mdash;is she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The hospitality of this house is prover&mdash;"
the precise doctor recommenced.</p>

<p>"Damn the hospitality!" cried Jacob Dolph:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87" href="#Page_87">[87]</a></span>
"I mean&mdash;oh, doctor&mdash;tell me&mdash;is anything
wrong?"</p>

<p>"Should I request of you the cup of amity
and geniality, Mr. Dolph, were there cause for
anything save rejoicing in this house?" demanded
the physician, with amiable severity.
"I had thought that my words would have
conveyed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's all over?"</p>

<p>"And bravely over!" And the doctor nodded
his head with a dignified cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"And may I go to her?"</p>

<p>"You may, sir, after you have given me my
glass of port. But remember, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dolph turned to the sideboard, grasped a
bottle and a glass, and thrust them into the
doctor's hand, and started for the door.</p>

<p>"But remember, sir," went on the unperturbed
physician, "you must not agitate or excite
her. A gentle step, a tranquil tone, and
a cheerful and encouraging address, brief and
affectionate, will be all that is permitted."</p>

<p>Dolph listened in mad impatience, and was
over the threshold before the doctor's peremptory
call brought him back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88" href="#Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span class="floatl">
<a href="images/ill-p088.jpg" >
<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p088-thumb.jpg" width="273" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</a></span>
"What is it now?" he demanded, impatiently.</p>

<p>The doctor looked at him with a gaze of
wonder and reproach.</p>

<p>"It is a male
child, sir," he
said.</p>

<p>Jacob Dolph
crept up the
stairs on tiptoe.
As he paused
for a moment
in front of a
door at the
head, he heard
the weak, spasmodic
wail of
another Dolph.</p>

<hr />

<p>"There's no help for it&mdash;I've got to do it,"
said Jacob Dolph.</p>

<p>It was another wintry morning, just after
breakfast. The snow was on the ground, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89" href="#Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the sleigh-bells up in Broadway sent down a
faint jingling. Ten winters had come and
gone, and Mr. Dolph was as comfortably stout
as a man should be who is well fed and forty.
He stood with his back to the fire, pulling at
his whiskers&mdash;which formed what was earlier
known as a Newgate collar&mdash;with his right
thumb and forefinger. His left thumb was
stuck in the armhole of his flowered satin
waistcoat, black and shiny.</p>

<p>Opposite him sat a man of his own age,
clean-shaven and sharp-featured. He had
calm, somewhat cold, gray eyes, a deliberate,
self-contained manner of speaking, and a pallid,
dry complexion that suited with his thin features.
His dress was plain, although it was
thoroughly neat. He had no flowered satin
waistcoat; but something in his bearing told
you that he was a man who had no anxiety
about the narrow things of the counting-room;
who had no need to ask himself how much
money was coming in to-morrow. And at the
same time you felt that every cent of whatever
might be to-morrow's dues would find its way
to his hands as surely as the representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" href="#Page_90">[90]</a></span>
figures stood on his ledger's page. It was
young Mr. Van Riper&mdash;but he, too, had lost
his right to that title, not only because of his
years, but because, in the garret of the house
in Greenwich Village, a cobweb stretched from
one of the low beams to the head of old
Abram Van Riper's great walking-stick, which
stood in the corner where it had been placed,
with other rubbish, the day after Abram Van
Riper's funeral.</p>

<p>"I should not advise it, Dolph, if it can be
helped," Mr. Van Riper observed, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"It can't be helped."</p>

<p>"I can give you your price, of course," Van
Riper went on, with deliberation; "but equally
of course, it won't be anything like what the
property will bring in the course of a few
years."</p>

<p>Dolph kicked at the hearthrug, as he answered,
somewhat testily:</p>

<p>"I'm not making a speculation of it."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Riper was unmoved.</p>

<p>"And I'm not making a speculation of you,
either," he said, calmly: "I am speaking only
for your own benefit, Dolph."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91" href="#Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Dolph put his hands in his pockets,
strode to the window and back again, and then
said, with an uneasy little laugh:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Van Riper; you're quite
right, of course. The fact is, I've got to do it.
I must have the money, and I must have it
now."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Riper stroked his sharp chin.</p>

<p>"Is it necessary to raise the money in that
particular way? You are temporarily embarrassed&mdash;I
don't wish to be intrusive&mdash;but why
not borrow what you need, and give me a
mortgage on the house?"</p>

<p>Ten years had given Jacob Dolph a certain
floridity; but at this he blushed a hot red.</p>

<p>"Mortgage on the house? No, sir," he said,
with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Well, any other security, then," was Van
Riper's indifferent amendment.</p>

<p>Again Jacob Dolph strode to the window
and back again, staring hard at the carpet, and
knitting his brows.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Riper waited in undisturbed calm
until his friend spoke once more.</p>

<p>"I might as well tell you the truth, Van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" href="#Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Riper," he said, at last; "I've made a fool of
myself. I've lost money, and I've got to
pocket the loss. As to borrowing, I've borrowed
all I ought to borrow. I <i>won't</i> mortgage
the house. This sale simply represents
the hole in my capital."</p>

<p>Something like a look of surprise came into
Mr. Van Riper's wintry eyes.</p>

<p>"It's none of my business, of course," he
observed; "but if you haven't any objection
to telling me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did it? What does for everybody
nowadays? Western lands and Wall Street&mdash;that's
about the whole story. Oh, yes, I know&mdash;I
ought to have kept out of it. But I
didn't. I was nothing better than a fool at
such business. I'm properly punished."</p>

<p>He sighed as he stood on the hearthrug,
his hands under his coat-tails, and his head
hanging down. He looked as though many
other thoughts were going through his mind
than those which he expressed.</p>

<p>"I wish," he began again, "that my poor old
father had brought me up to business ways.
I might have kept out of it all. College is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93" href="#Page_93">[93]</a></span>
good thing for a man, of course; but college
doesn't teach you how to buy lots in western
cities&mdash;especially when the western cities
aren't built."</p>

<p>"College teaches you a good many other
things, though," said Van Riper, frowning
slightly, as he put the tips of his long fingers
together; "I wish I'd had your chance,
Dolph. <i>My</i> boy shall go to Columbia, that's
certain."</p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> boy?" queried Dolph, raising his
eyebrows.</p>

<p>Van Riper smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "my boy. You didn't
know I had a boy, did you? He's nearly a
year old."</p>

<p>This made Mr. Jacob Dolph kick at the rug
once more, and scowl a little.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I haven't been very neighborly,
Van Riper&mdash;" he began; but the other interrupted
him, smiling good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"You and I go different ways, Dolph," he
said. "We're plain folks over in Greenwich
Village, and you&mdash;you're a man of fashion."</p>

<p>Jacob Dolph smiled&mdash;not very mirthfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94" href="#Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Van Riper's gaze travelled around the room,
quietly curious.</p>

<p>"It costs money to be a man of fashion,
doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dolph, "it does."</p>

<p>There was silence for a minute, which Van
Riper broke.</p>

<p>"If you've got to sell, Dolph, why, it's a
pity; but I'll take it. I'll see Ogden to-day, and
we can finish the business whenever you wish.
But in my opinion, you'd do better to borrow."</p>

<p>Dolph shook his head.</p>

<p>"I've been quite enough of a fool," he replied.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Van Riper, rising, "I must
get to the office. You'll hear from Ogden to-morrow.
I'm sorry you've got in such a
snarl; but&mdash;" his lips stretched into something
like a smile&mdash;"I suppose you'll know better
next time. Good-day."</p>

<hr />

<p>After Mr. Dolph had bowed his guest to
the door, Mrs. Dolph slipped down the stairs
and into the drawing-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95" href="#Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did he take it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Of course he took it," Dolph answered,
bitterly, "at that price."</p>

<p>"Did he say anything," she inquired again,
"about its being hard for us to&mdash;to sell it?"</p>

<p>"He said we had better not sell it now&mdash;that
it would bring more a few years hence."</p>

<p>"He doesn't understand," said Mrs. Dolph.</p>

<p>"He <i>couldn't</i> understand," said Mr. Dolph.</p>

<p>Then she went over to him and kissed
him.</p>

<p>"It's only selling the garden, after all," she
said; "it isn't like selling our home."</p>

<p>He put his arm about her waist, and they
walked into the breakfast-room, and looked out
on the garden which to-morrow would be
theirs no longer, and in a few months would
not be a garden at all.</p>

<p>High walls hemmed it in&mdash;the walls of the
houses which had grown up around them. A
few stalks stood up out of the snow, the stalks
of old-fashioned flowers&mdash;hollyhock and larkspur
and Job's-tears and the like&mdash;and the
lines of the beds were defined by the tiny
hedges of box, with the white snow-powder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96" href="#Page_96">[96]</a></span>
sifted into their dark, shiny green. The bare
rose-bushes were there, with their spikes of
thorns, and little mounds of snow showed
where the glories of the poppy-bed had
bloomed.</p>

<p>Jacob Dolph, looking out, saw the clear
summer sunlight lying where the snow lay
now. He saw his mother moving about the
paths, cutting a flower here and a bud there.
He saw himself, a little boy in brave breeches,
following her about, and looking for the harmless
toads, and working each one into one of
the wonderful legends which he had heard
from the old German gardener across the way.
He saw his father, too, pacing those paths of
summer evenings, when the hollyhocks nodded
their pink heads, and glancing up, from time
to time, at his mother as she sat knitting at
that very window. And, last of all in the line,
yet first in his mind, he saw his wife tripping
out in the fresh morning, to smile on the flowers
she loved, to linger lovingly over the beds
of verbena, and to pick the little nosegay that
stood by the side of the tall coffee-urn at every
summer-morning breakfast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97" href="#Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>And the wife, looking out by his side, saw
that splendid boy of theirs running over path
and bed, glad of the flowers and the air and
the freedom, full of young life and boyish
sprightliness, his long hair floating behind him,
the light of hope and youth in his bright face.</p>

<p>And to-morrow it would be Van Riper's;
and very soon there would be houses there, to
close up the friendly window which had seen
so much, which had let so much innocent joy
and gladness into the old breakfast-room; and
there would be an end of flower-bordered
paths and nodding hollyhocks. She put her
face upon her husband's shoulder, and cried a
little, though he pretended not to know it.
When she lifted it, somehow she had got her
eyes dry, though they were painfully bright
and large.</p>

<p>"It isn't like selling our house," she <ins class="correction" id="Note_2" title="Transcriber's note: period inserted">said.</ins></p>

<h2>IV.</h2>


<p>Jacob Dolph got out of the Broadway
stage at Bowling Green, followed by Eustace
Dolph. Eustace Dolph at twenty-two
was no more like his father than his patrician
name was like simple and scriptural Jacob.
The elder Dolph was a personable man, certainly;
a handsome man, even, who looked to
be nearer forty than fifty-two; and he was well
dressed&mdash;perhaps a trifle out of the mode&mdash;and
carried himself with a certain genial dignity,
and with the lightness of a man who has not
forgotten that he has been a buck in his time.
But Eustace was distinctly and unmistakably
a dandy. There are superficial differences, of
course, between the dandy of 1852 and the
dandy of 1887; but the structural foundation
of all types of dandy is the same through all
ages. Back of the clothes&mdash;back of the ruffles,
or the bright neckcloth, or the high pickardil&mdash;which
may vary with the time or the individual,
you will ever find clearly displayed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99" href="#Page_99">[99]</a></span>
your eyes the obvious and unmistakable spiritual
reason for and cause of the dandy&mdash;and it
is always self-assertion pushed beyond the
bounds of self-respect.</p>

<p>Now, as a matter of fact, young Eustace's
garments were not really worse than many a
man has worn from simple, honest bad taste.
To be sure, the checked pattern of his trousers
was for size like the design of a prison grating;
he had a coat so blue that it shimmered in the
sunlight; his necktie was of purple satin, and
fearfully and wonderfully made and fringed,
and decked with gems fastened by little gold
chains to other inferior guardian gems; and
his waistcoat was confected of satin and velvet
and damask all at once; yet you might
have put all these things on his father, and,
although the effect would not have been pleasant,
you would never have called the elder gentleman
a dandy. In other words, it was <ins class="correction" id="Note_3" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'Why'">why</ins>
young Eustace wore his raiment that made it
dandified, and not the inherent gorgeousness
of the raiment itself.</p>

<p>The exchange of attire might readily have
been made, so far as the size of the two men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100" href="#Page_100">[100]</a></span>
was concerned. But only in size were they
alike. There was nothing of the Dolph in
Eustace's face. He bore, indeed, a strong resemblance
to his maternal great-grandmother,
now many years put away where she could no
longer trouble the wicked, and where she had
to let the weary be at rest. (And how poor
little Aline had wept and wailed over that
death, and lamented that she had not been
more dutiful as a child!) But his face was not
strong, as the face of Madam Des Anges had
been. Some strain of a weaker ancestry reappeared
in it, and, so to speak, changed the
key of the expression. What had been pride in
the old lady bordered on superciliousness in the
young man. What had been sternness became
a mere haughtiness. Yet it was a handsome
face, and pleasant, too, when the young smile
came across it, and you saw the white small teeth
and the bright, intelligent light in the dark eyes.</p>

<p>The two men strolled through the Battery,
and then up South Street, and so around
through Old Slip. They were on business;
but this was also a pleasure trip to the elder.
He walked doubly in spirit through those old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101" href="#Page_101">[101]</a></span>
streets&mdash;a boy by his father's side, a father
with his son at his elbow. He had not been
often in the region of late years. You remember,
he was a man of pleasure. He was one
of the first-fruits of metropolitan growth and
social culture. His father had made an idler
and <i>dilettante</i> of him. It was only half a life
at best, he thought, happy as he had been;
blessed as he was in wife and child. He was
going to make a business man of his own boy.
After all, it was through the workers that great
cities grew. Perhaps we were not ripe yet for
that European institution, the idler. He himself
had certain accomplishments that other
Americans had not. He could <i>flâner</i>, for
instance. But to have to <i>flâner</i> through fifty
or sixty or seventy years palled on the spirit,
he found. And one thing was certain, if any
Dolph was ever to be an accomplished <i>flâneur</i>,
and to devote his whole life to that occupation,
the Dolph fortune must be vastly increased.
Old Jacob Dolph had miscalculated. The sum
he had left in 1829 might have done very well
for the time, but it was no fortune to idle on
among the fashionables of 1852.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102" href="#Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Something of this Mr. Dolph told his son;
but the young man, although he listened with
respectful attention, appeared not to take a
deep interest in his father's reminiscences.
Jacob Dolph fancied even that Eustace did
not care to be reminded of the city's day of
small things. Perhaps he had something of
the feeling of the successful struggler who
tries to forget the shabbiness of the past. If
this were the case, his pride must have been
chafed, for his father was eloquent in displaying
the powers of an uncommonly fine memory;
and he had to hear all about the slips,
and the Fly Market, and the gradual extension
of the water-front, and the piles on which the
old Tontine was built, and the cucumber-wood
pipes of the old water-company, still lying
under their feet. Once, at least, he showed a
genuine enjoyment of his father's discourse,
and that was when it ran on the great retinue
of servants in which Jacob Dolph the elder
had indulged himself. I think he was actually
pleased when he heard that his grandfather
had at one time kept slaves.</p>

<p>Wandering in this way, to the running accompaniment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" href="#Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of Mr. Dolph's lecture, they
came to Water Street, and here, as though he
were reminded of the object of their trip, the
father summed up his reminiscences in shape
for a neat moral.</p>

<p>"The city grows, you see, my boy, and
we've got to grow with it. I've stood still;
but you sha'n't."</p>

<p>"Well, governor," said the younger man,
"I'll be frank with you. I don't like the prospect."</p>

<p>"You will&mdash;you will, my boy. You'll live
to thank me."</p>

<p>"Very likely you're right, sir; I don't deny
it; but, as I say, I don't like the prospect. I
don't see&mdash;with all due respect, sir&mdash;how any
gentleman can <i>like</i> trade. It may be necessary,
and of course I don't think it's lowering,
or any of that nonsense, you know; but it
can't be <i>pleasant</i>. Of course, if <i>your</i> governor
had to do it, it was all right; but I don't believe
he liked it any better than I should, or
he wouldn't have been so anxious to keep you
out of it."</p>

<p>"My poor father made a great mistake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" href="#Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Eustace. He would admit it now, I'm sure, if
he were alive."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I'm going to try it, of course.
I'll give it a fair trial. But when the two
years are up, sir, as we agreed, I hope you
won't say anything against my going into the
law, or&mdash;well, yes&mdash;" he colored a little&mdash;"trying
what I can do on the Street. I know what
you think about it, sir," he went on, hastily;
"but there are two sides to the question, and
it's my opinion that, for an intelligent man,
there's more money to be made up there in
Wall Street in one year than can be got out
of haggling over merchandise for a lifetime."</p>

<p>Jacob Dolph grew red in the face and shook
his head vigorously.</p>

<p>"Don't speak of it, sir, don't speak of it!"
he said, vehemently. "It's the curse of the
country. If you have any such infernal opinions,
don't vent them in my presence, sir. I
know what I am talking about. Keep clear of
Wall Street, sir. It is the straight road to
perdition."</p>

<p>They entered one of a row of broad-fronted
buildings of notable severity and simplicity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105" href="#Page_105">[105]</a></span>
architecture. Four square stone columns upheld
its brick front, and on one of these faded
gilt letters, on a ground of dingy black, said
simply:</p>

<p class="titles_large">
<b>ABRAM VAN RIPER'S SON.</b>
</p>

<p>There was no further announcement of
Abram Van Riper's Son's character, or of the
nature of his business. It was assumed that
all people knew who Abram Van Riper's Son
was, and that his (Abram Van Riper's) ship-chandlery
trade had long before grown into
a great "commission merchant's" business.</p>

<p>It was full summer, and there were no doors
between the pillars to bar entrance to the
gloomy cavern behind them, which stretched
in semi-darkness the whole length and width
of the building, save for a narrow strip at the
rear, where, behind a windowed partition, clerks
were writing at high desks, and where there
was an inner and more secluded pen for Abram
Van Riper's son.</p>

<p>In the front of the cave, to one side, was a
hoistway, where bales and boxes were drawn
up from the cellar or swung twisting and twirling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106" href="#Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to the lofts above. Amidships the place
was strewn with small tubs, matting-covered
bales and boxes, coils of bright new rope, and
odd-looking packages of a hundred sorts, all of
them with gaping wounds in their envelopes,
or otherwise having their pristine integrity
wounded. From this it was not difficult to
<span class="floatl">

<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p106-thumb.jpg" width="265" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</a></span>
guess that these
were samples of
merchandise.
Most of them
gave forth odors
upon the air,
odors ranging
from the purely
aromatic, suggestive
of Oriental
fancies or tropic
dreams of spice, to the positively offensive&mdash;the
latter varieties predominating.</p>


<p>But certain objects upon a long table were
so peculiar in appearance that the visitors
could not pass them by with a mere glance of
wonder. They looked like small leather pies,
badly warped in the baking. A clerk in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107" href="#Page_107">[107]</a></span>
shirt sleeves, with his straw hat on one side of
his head, whistled as he cut into these, revealing
a livid interior, the color of half-cooked
veal, which he inspected with care. Eustace
was moved to positive curiosity.</p>

<p>"What are they?" he inquired of the clerk,
pride mingling with disgust in his tone, as he
caught a smell like unto the smell which might
arise from raw smoked salmon that had lain
three days in the sun.</p>

<p>"Central American," responded the clerk,
with brevity, and resumed his whistling of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">To make me a preacher my father did try."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Central American <i>what</i>?" pursued the inquirer.</p>

<p>"<i>Rubber!</i>" said the clerk, with a scorn so
deep and far beyond expression that the combined
pride of the Dolphs and the Des Anges
wilted into silence for the moment. As they
went on toward the rear office, while the clerk
gayly whistled the notes of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It's no use a-blowing, for I am a hard 'un&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'm bound to be a butcher, by heavens, or die!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108" href="#Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Eustace recovered sufficiently to demand of
his father:</p>

<p>"I say, sir, shall I have to handle that
damned stuff?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said his senior; "here's Mr. Van
Riper."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Riper came to the office door to
welcome them, with his thin face set in the
form of a smile.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "here's the young man, is
he? Fine big fellow, Dolph. Well, sir, so
you are going to embrace a mercantile career,
are you? That's what they call it in these
fine days, Dolph."</p>

<p>"I am going to try to, sir," replied the
young man.</p>

<p>"He will, Van Riper," put in his father,
hastily; "he'll like it as soon as he gets used
to it&mdash;I know he will."</p>

<p>"Well," returned Mr. Van Riper, with an
attempt at facetious geniality, "we'll try to
get his nose down to the grindstone, we will.
Come into my office with me, Dolph, and I'll
hand this young gentleman over to old Mr.
Daw. Mr. Daw will feel his teeth&mdash;eh, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" href="#Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Daw?&mdash;see what he <i>doesn't</i> know&mdash;how's that,
Mr. Daw? You remember Mr. Daw, Dolph&mdash;used
to be with your father before he went out
of business&mdash;been with us ever since. Let's
see, how long is that, Daw? Most fifty years,
ain't it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Daw, who looked as though he might
have been one hundred years at the business,
wheeled around and descended with stiff deliberation
from his high stool, holding his pen
in his mouth as he solemnly shook hands with
Jacob Dolph, and peered into his face. Then
he took the pen out of his mouth.</p>

<p>"Looks like his father," was Mr. Daw's comment.
"Forty-five years the twenty-ninth of
this month, sir. You was a little shaver then.
I remember you comin' into the store and
whittlin' timber with your little jack-knife. I
was only eleven years with your father, sir&mdash;eleven
years and six months&mdash;went to him
when I was fourteen years old. That's fifty-six
years and six months in the service of two
of the best houses that ever was in New York&mdash;an'

shavers in the town&mdash;ain't missed a day in nineteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110" href="#Page_110">[110]</a></span>
years now. Your father hadn't never
ought to have gone out of business, Mr. Dolph.
He did a great business for those days, and he
had the makin' of a big house. Goin' to bring
your boy up like a good New York merchant,
hey? Come along here with me, young man,
and I'll see if you're half the man your grandfather
was. He hadn't never ought to have
given up business, Mr. Dolph. But he was all
for pleasuring an' the play-houses, an' havin'
fine times. Come along, young man. What's
your name?"</p>

<p>"Eustace Dolph."</p>

<p>"Hm! Jacob's better."</p>

<p>And he led the neophyte away.</p>

<p>"Curious old case," said Mr. Van Riper,
dryly. "Best accountant in New York. See
that high stool of his?&mdash;can't get him off it.
Five years ago I gave him a low desk and an
arm-chair. In one week he was back again,
roosting up there. Said he didn't feel comfortable
with his feet on the ground. He
thought that sort of thing might do for
aged people, but <i>he</i> wasn't made of cotton-batting."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111" href="#Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus began Eustace Dolph's apprenticeship
to business, and mightily ill he liked it.</p>

<hr />

<p>There came a day, a winter day in 1854,
when there was great agitation among what
were then called the real old families of New
York. I cannot use the term "fashionable
society," because that is more comprehensive,
and would include many wealthy and ambitious
families from New England, who were
decidedly not of the Dolphs' set. And then,
the Dolphs could hardly be reckoned among
the leaders of fashion. To live on or near the
boundaries of fashion's domain is to lower your
social status below the absolute pitch of perfection,
and fashion in 1854 drew the line pretty
sharply at Bleecker Street. Above Bleecker
Street the cream of the cream rose to the surface;
below, you were ranked as skim milk.
The social world was spreading up into the
wastes sacred to the circus and the market-garden,
although, if Admiral Farragut had
stood on his sea-legs where he stands now, he
might have had a fairly clear view of Chelsea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" href="#Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Village, and seen Alonzo Cushman II., or
Alonzo Cushman III., perhaps, going around
and collecting his rents.</p>

<p>But the old families still fought the tide of
trade, many of them neck-deep and very uncomfortable.
They would not go from St.
John's Park, nor from North Moore and Grand
Streets. They had not the <i>bourgeois</i> conservatism
of the Greenwich Villagers, which has
held them in a solid phalanx almost to this
very day; but still, in a way, they resented the
up-town movement, and resisted it. So that
when they did have to buy lots in the high-numbered
streets they had to pay a fine price
for them.</p>

<p>It was this social party that was stirred by a
bit of scandal about the Dolphs. I do not
know why I should call it scandal; yet I am
sure society so held it. For did not society
whisper it, and nod and wink over it, and tell
it in dark corners, and chuckle, and lift its
multitudinous hands and its myriad eyebrows,
and say in innumerable keys: "Well, <i>upon</i> my
word!" and "Well, I <i>should</i> think&mdash;&mdash;!" and
"Who would <i>ever</i> have thought of such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113" href="#Page_113">[113]</a></span>
thing?" and the like? Did not society make
very funny jokes about it, and did not society's
professional gossips get many an invitation to
dinner because they professed to have authentic
details of the way Mr. and Mrs. Dolph
looked when they spoke about it, and just what
they had to say for themselves?</p>

<p>And yet it was nothing more than this, that
Mr. Dolph being fifty-four, and his wife but a
few years younger, were about to give to the
world another Dolph. It was odd, I admit; it
was unusual; if I must go so far, it was, I suppose,
unconventional. But I don't see that it
was necessary for Mr. Philip Waters to make
an epigram about it. It was a very clever epigram;
but if you had seen dear old Mrs.
Dolph, with her rosy cheeks and the gray in
her hair, knitting baby-clothes with hands
which were still white and plump and comely,
while great dark eyes looked timorously into
the doubtful, fear-clouded future, I think you
would have been ashamed that you had even
listened to that epigram.</p>

<p>The expected event was of special and personal
interest to only three people&mdash;for, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114" href="#Page_114">[114]</a></span>
all, when you think of it, it was not exactly
society's business&mdash;and it affected them in
widely different ways.</p>

<p>Jacob Dolph was all tenderness to his wife,
and all sympathy with her fears, with her nervous
apprehensions, even with her morbid
forebodings of impossible ills. He did not
repine at the seclusion which the situation
forced upon them, although his life for years
had been given up to society's demands, until
pleasure-seeking and pleasure-giving had grown
into a routine, which occupied his whole mind.
His wife saw him more than she had for many
years. Clubs and card-parties had few temptations
for him now; he sat at home and read
to her and talked to her, and did his best to
follow the injunctions of the doctor, and "create
and preserve in her a spirit of cheerful and
hopeful tranquillity, free of unnecessary apprehension."</p>

<p>But when he <i>did</i> go to the club, when he was
in male society, his breast expanded, and if he
had to answer a polite inquiry as to Mrs.
Dolph's general health, I am afraid that he responded:
"Mrs. Dolph is extremely well, sir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115" href="#Page_115">[115]</a></span>
extremely well!" with a pride which the moralists
will tell you is baseless, unworthy, and
unreasonable.</p>

<p>As for Aline herself, no one may know what
timorous hopes stirred in her bosom and
charmed the years away, and brought back
to her a lovely youth that was almost girlish
in its innocent, half-frightened gladness. Outside,
this great, wise, eminently proper world
that she lived in girded <ins class="correction" id="Note_4" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'at the the old'">at the old</ins> woman
who was to bear a child, and laughed behind
tasselled fans, and made wondrous merry over
Nature's work; but within the old house she
sat, and sewed upon the baby-clothes, or, wandering
from cupboard to cupboard, found the
yellowing garments, laid away more than a
score of years before&mdash;the poor little lace-decked
trifles that her first boy had worn; and
she thanked heaven, in her humble way, that
twenty-four years had not taken the love and
joy of a wife and a mother out of her heart.</p>

<p>She could not find all her boy's dresses and
toys, for she was open-handed, and had given
many of them away to people who needed
them. This brought about an odd encounter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" href="#Page_116">[116]</a></span>
The third person who had a special interest in
the prospect of the birth of a Dolph was young
Eustace, and he found nothing in it wherewith
to be pleased. For Eustace Dolph was of the
ultra-fashionables. He cared less for old family
than for new ideas, and he did not let himself
fall behind in the march of social progress,
even though he was, as he admitted with humility
born of pride, only a poor devil of a
down-town clerk. If his days were occupied,
he had his nights to himself, and he lengthened
them to suit himself. At first this caused his
mother to fret a little; but poor Aline had
come into her present world from the conventional
seclusion of King's Bridge, and her only
authority on questions of masculine license was
her husband. He, being appealed to, had to
admit that his own hours in youth had been
late, and that he supposed the hours of a
newer generation should properly be later still.
Mr. Dolph forgot, perhaps, that while his early
potations had been vinous, those of the later age
were distinctly spirituous; and that the early
morning cocktail and the midnight brandy-and-soda
were abominations unknown to his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117" href="#Page_117">[117]</a></span>
well-bred youth. With port and sherry and
good Bordeaux he had been familiar all his
life; a dash of <i>liqueur</i> after dinner did not
trouble his digestion; he found a bottle of
champagne a pleasant appetizer and a gentle
stimulant; but whiskey and gin were to him
the drinks of the vulgar; and rum and brandy
stood on his sideboard only to please fiercer
tastes than his own. Perhaps, also, he was ignorant
of the temptations that assail a young
man in a great city, he who had grown up in
such a little one that he had at one time
known every one who was worth knowing in it.</p>

<p>However this may have been, Eustace
Dolph ruled for himself his going out and his
coming in. He went further, and chose his
own associates, not always from among the
scions of the "old families." He found those
excellent young men "slow," and he selected
for his own private circle a set which was
mixed as to origin and unanimously frivolous
as to tendency. The foreign element was
strongly represented. Bright young Irishmen
of excellent families, and mysterious French
and Italian counts and marquises, borrowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118" href="#Page_118">[118]</a></span>
many of the good gold dollars of the Dolphs,
and forgot to return an equivalent in the
local currency of the O'Reagans of Castle
Reagan, or the D'Arcy de Montmorenci, or
<span class="floatl">
<a href="images/ill-p118.jpg" >
<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p118-thumb.jpg" width="207" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</a></span>
the Montescudi di Bajocchi.
Among this set there was
much merry-making when the
news from the Dolph household
sifted down to them
from the gossip-sieve of the
best society. They could not
very well chaff young Dolph
openly, for he was muscular and high-tempered,
and, under the most agreeable conditions,
needed a fight of some sort every six
months or so, and liked a bit of trouble in between
fights. But a good deal of low and
malicious humor came his way, from one
source or another, and he, with the hot and
concentrated egotism of youth, thought that
he was in a ridiculous and trying position, and
chafed over it.</p>

<p>There had been innuendos and hints and
glancing allusions, but no one had dared to
make any direct assault of wit, until one evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" href="#Page_119">[119]</a></span>
young Haskins came into the club "a little
flushed with wine." (The "wine" was brandy.)
It seems that young Haskins had found at
home an ivory rattle which had belonged to
Eustace twenty years before, and which Mrs.
Dolph had given to Mrs. Haskins when Eustace
enlarged his horizon in the matter of
toys.</p>

<p>Haskins, being, as I have said, somewhat
flushed with brandy, came up to young Dolph,
who was smoking in the window, and meditating
with frowning brows, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Here, Dolph, I've done with this. You'd
better take it back&mdash;it may be wanted down
your way."</p>

<p>There was a scene. Fortunately, two men
were standing just behind Dolph, who were
able to throw their arms about him, and hold
him back for a few seconds. There would
have been further consequences, however, if it
had not been that Eustace was in the act of
throwing the rattle back at Haskins when the
two men caught him. Thus the toy went
wide of its mark, and fell in the lap of Philip
Waters, who, old as he was, generally chose to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120" href="#Page_120">[120]</a></span>
be in the company of the young men at the
club; and then Philip Waters did something
that almost atones, I think, for the epigram.</p>

<p>He looked at the date on the rattle, and then
he rose up and went between the two young
men, and spoke to Haskins.</p>

<p>"Young man," he said, "when Mrs. Jacob
Dolph gave your mother this thing, your father
had just failed for the second time in three
years. He had come to New York about five
years before from Hartford, or Providence, or&mdash;Succotash,
or whatever his confounded town
was. Mr. Jacob Dolph got Mr. Van Riper to
give your father an extension on his note, or
he would have gone to the debtors' prison
down by the City Hall. As it was, he had to
sell his house, and the coat off his back, for all
I know. If it hadn't been for the Dolphs, devil
the rattle you'd have had, and you wouldn't
have been living in Bond Street to-day."</p>

</a><p class="caption">"If it hadn't been for the Dolphs, devil the rattle you'd have had."</p>
</div>

<p>After which Mr. Philip Waters sat down and
read the evening paper; and when young Haskins
was able to speak he asked young Dolph's
pardon, and got it&mdash;at least, a formal assurance
that he had it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121" href="#Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The baby was born in the spring, and everybody
said she was the image of her mother.</p>

<hr />

<p>There will come a day, it may be, when advancing
civilization will civilize sleighing out
of existence, as far as New York is concerned.
Year after year the days grow fewer that will
let a cutter slip up beyond the farthest of the
"road-houses" and cross the line into Westchester.
People say that the climate is changing;
but close observers recognize a sympathy
between the decrease of snow-storms and the
increase of refinement&mdash;that is, a sympathy in
inverse ratio; a balanced progress in opposite
directions. As we grow further and further
beyond even old-world standards of polite
convention, as we formalize and super-formalize
our codes, and steadily eliminate every
element of amusement from our amusements,
Nature in strict conformity represses her joyous
exuberance. The snow-storm of the past
is gone, because the great public sleigh that
held twenty-odd merry-makers in a shell like a
circus band-wagon has gone out of fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" href="#Page_122">[122]</a></span>
among all classes. Now we have, during severe
winters, just enough snow from time to time to
bear the light sleigh of the young man who,
being in good society, is also horsy. When
<i>he</i> finds the road vulgar, the poor plebeian
souls who go sleighing for the sport of it may
sell their red and blue vehicles, for Nature, the
sycophant of fashion, will snow no more.</p>

<p>But they had "good old-fashioned" snow-storms
eighty years after the Declaration of
Independence, and one had fallen upon New
York that tempted Mrs. Jacob Dolph to leave
her baby, ten months old, in the nurse's
charge, and go out with her husband in the
great family sleigh for what might be the last
ride of the season.</p>

<p>They had been far up the road&mdash;to Arcularius's,
maybe, there swinging around and
whirling back. They had flown down the long
country road, and back into the city, to meet&mdash;it
was early in the day&mdash;the great procession
of sleighing folk streaming northward up
Broadway. It was one of New York's great,
irregular, chance-set carnivals, and every sleigh
was out, from the "exquisite's" gilded chariot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" href="#Page_123">[123]</a></span>
a shell hardly larger than a fair-sized easy-chair,
to the square, low-hung red sledge of
the butcher-boy, who braved it with the fashionables,
his <i>Schneider</i>-made clothes on his
burly form, and his girl by his side, in her best
Bowery bonnet. Everybody was a-sleighing.
The jingle of countless bells fell on the crisp
air in a sort of broken rhythm&mdash;a rude <i>tempo
rubato</i>. It was fashionable then. But we&mdash;we
amuse ourselves less boisterously.</p>

<p>They drew up at the door of the Dolph
house, and Jacob Dolph lifted his wife out of
the sleigh, and carried her up the steps into
the breakfast-room, and set her down in her
easy-chair. He was bending over her to ask
her if her ride had done her good, when a servant
entered and handed him a letter marked
"Immediate."</p>

<p>He read it, and all the color of the winter's
day faded out of his face.</p>

<p>"I've got to go down to Van Riper's," he
said, "at once; he wants me."</p>

<p>"Has anything happened to&mdash;to Eustace?"
his wife cried out.</p>

<p>"He doesn't say so&mdash;I suppose&mdash;I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" href="#Page_124">[124]</a></span>
it's only business of some sort," her husband
said. His face was white. "Don't detain me,
dear. I'll come back as soon as&mdash;as soon as I
get through."</p>

<p>He kissed her, and was gone. Half an hour
later he sat in the office of Abram Van Riper's
Son.</p>

<p>There was no doubting it, no denying it, no
palliating it even. The curse had come upon
the house of Jacob Dolph, and his son was a
thief and a fugitive.</p>

<p>It was an old story and a simple story. It
was the story of the Haskins's million and the
Dolphs' hundred thousand; it was the story of
the boy with a hundred thousand in prospect
trying to spend money against the boy with
a million in sight. It was the story of cards,
speculation&mdash;another name for that sort of
gambling which is worse than any on the
green cloth&mdash;and what is euphemistically
known as wine.</p>

<p>There was enough oral and documentary
evidence to make the whole story hideously
clear to Jacob Dolph, as he sat in that dark
little pen of Van Riper's and had the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125" href="#Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of his son's fall spelled out to him, word by
word. The boy had proved himself apt and
clever in his office work. His education had
given him an advantage over all the other
clerks, and he had learned his duties with wonderful
ease. And when, six months before,
old Mr. Daw had let himself down from his
stool for the last time, and had muffled up his
thin old throat in his great green worsted
scarf, and had gone home to die, young Dolph
had been put temporarily in his place. In
those six months he had done his bad work.
Even Van Riper admitted that it must have
been a sudden temptation. But&mdash;he had
yielded. In those six months fifty thousand
dollars of Abram Van Riper's money had
gone into the gulf that yawned in Wall Street;
fifty thousand dollars, not acquired by falsifying
the books, but filched outright from the
private safe to which he had access; fifty
thousand dollars, in securities which he had
turned into money, acting as the confidential
man of the house.</p>

<p>When Jacob Dolph, looking like a man of
eighty, left the private office of Mr. Van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" href="#Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Riper he had two things to do. One was to
tell his wife, the other was to assign enough
property to Van Riper to cover the amount of
the defalcation. Both had been done before
night.</p>

<h2>V.</h2>


<p>It is to be said for society that there was
very little chuckling and smiling when this
fresh piece of news about the Dolphs came out.
Nor did the news pass from house to house like
wildfire. It rather leaked out here and there,
percolating through barriers of friendly silence,
slipping from discreet lips and repeated in
anxious confidence, with all manner of qualifications
and hopeful suppositions and suggestions.
As a matter of fact, people never really
knew just what Eustace Dolph had done, or
how far his wrong-doing had carried him. All
that was ever positively known was that the
boy had got into trouble down-town, and had
gone to Europe. The exact nature of the
trouble could only be conjectured. The very
brokers who had been the instruments of
young Dolph's ruin were not able to separate
his authorized speculations from those which
were illegitimate. They could do no more than
guess, from what they knew of Van Riper's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128" href="#Page_128">[128]</a></span>
conservative method of investment, that the
young man's unfortunate purchases were made
for himself, and they figured these at fifty-five
thousand odd hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Somebody, who looked up the deed which
Jacob Dolph executed that winter day, found
that he had transferred to Van Riper real
estate of more than that value.</p>

<p>No word ever came from the cold lips of
Abram Van Riper's son; and his office was a
piece of all but perfect machinery, which dared
not creak when he commanded silence. And
no one save Van Riper and Dolph, and their
two lawyers, knew the whole truth. Dolph
never even spoke about it to his wife, after
that first night. It was these five people only
who knew that Mr. Jacob Dolph had parted
with the last bit of real estate that he owned,
outside of his own home, and they knew that
his other property was of a doubtful sort, that
could yield at the best only a very limited income&mdash;hardly
enough for a man who lived in
so great a house, and whose doors were open
to all his friends nine months in the year.</p>

<p>Yet he stayed there, and grew old with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129" href="#Page_129">[129]</a></span>
age which the years have not among their gifts.
When his little girl was large enough to sit
upon his knee, her small hands clutched at a
snowy-white mustache, and she complained
that his great, dark, hollow eyes never would
look "right into hers, away down deep." Yet
he loved her, and talked more to her perhaps
than to any one else, not even excepting Aline.</p>

<p>But he never spoke to her of the elder
brother whom she could not remember. It
was her mother who whispered something of
the story to her, and told her not to let papa
know that she knew of it, for it would grieve
him. Aline herself knew nothing about the
boy save that he lived, and lived a criminal.
Jacob himself could only have told her that
their son was a wandering adventurer, known
as a blackleg and sharper in every town in
Europe.</p>

<p>The doors of the great house were closed to
all the world, or opened only for some old
friend, who went away very soon out of the
presence of a sadness beyond all solace of
words, or kindly look, or hand-clasp. And so,
in something that only the grace of their gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" href="#Page_130">[130]</a></span>
lives relieved from absolute poverty, those
three dwelt in the old house, and let the world
slip by them.</p>

<hr />

<p>There was no sleep for any one of the little
household in the great house on the night of
the 14th of July, 1863. Doors and blinds were
closed; only a light shone through the half-open
slats at a second-story window, and in that room
Aline lay sick, almost unto death, her white
hair loosed from its usual dainty neatness, her
dark eyes turning with an unmeaning gaze
from the face of the little girl at her side to the
face of her husband at the foot of her bed.
Her hands, wrinkled and small, groped over
the coverlet, with nervous twitchings, as every
now and then the howls or the pistol-shots of
the mob in the streets below them fell on her
ear. And at every such movement the lips of
the girl by her pillow twitched in piteous sympathy.
About half-past twelve there was
sharp firing in volleys to the southward of
them, that threw the half-conscious sufferer
into an agony of supersensitive disturbance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131" href="#Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Then there came a silence that seemed unnaturally
deep, yet it was only the silence of a
summer night in the deserted city streets.</p>

<p>Through it they heard, sharp and sudden,
with something inexplicably fearful about it,
the patter of running feet. They had heard
that sound often enough that night and the
night before; but these feet stopped at their
own door, and came up the steps, and the runner
beat and pounded on the heavy panels.</p>

<p>Father and child looked in each other's eyes,
and then Jacob Dolph left his post at the foot
of the bed, and, passing out of the room, went
down the stairs with deliberate tread, and
opened the door.</p>

<p>A negro's face, almost gray in its mad fear,
stared into his with a desperate appeal which
the lips could not utter. Dolph drew the man
in, and shut the door behind him. The negro
leaned, trembling and exhausted, against the
wall.</p>

<p>"I knowed you'd take me in, Mist' Dolph,"
he panted; "I'm feared they seen me, though&mdash;they
was mighty clost behind."</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/ill-p131.jpg" >
<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p131-thumb.jpg" width="313" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</a></div>

<p>They were close behind him, indeed. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132" href="#Page_132">[132]</a></span>
half a minute the roar of the mob filled the
street with one terrible howl and shriek of
animal rage, heard high
above the tramp of half a thousand
feet; and the beasts of disorder, gathered
from all the city's holes and dens of crime,
wild for rapine and outrage, burst upon them,
sweeping up the steps, hammering at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133" href="#Page_133">[133]</a></span>
great doors, crying for the blood of the helpless
and the innocent.</p>

<p>Foreign faces, almost all! Irish, mostly; but
there were heavy, ignorant German types of
feature uplifted under the gas-light; sallow,
black-mustached Magyar faces; thin, acute,
French faces&mdash;all with the stamp of old-world
ignorance and vice upon them.</p>

<p>The door opened, and the white-haired old
gentleman, erect, haughty, with brightening
eyes, faced the leader of the mob&mdash;a great
fellow, black-bearded, who had a space to himself
on the stoop, and swung his broad shoulders
from side to side.</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/ill-p133.jpg" >
<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p133-thumb.jpg" width="288" height="400" alt="Have you got a nigger here?" title="" />
</a><p class="caption">"Have you got a nigger here?"</p>
</div>

<p>"Have you got a nigger here?" he began,
and then stopped short, for Jacob Dolph was
looking upon the face of his son.</p>

<p>Vagabond and outcast, he had the vagabond's
quick wit, this leader of infuriate crime,
and some one good impulse stirred in him of
his forfeited gentlehood. He turned savagely
upon his followers.</p>

<p>"He ain't here!" he roared. "I told you
so&mdash;I saw him turn the corner."</p>

<p>"Shtap an' burrn the bondholder's house!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" href="#Page_134">[134]</a></span>
yelled a man behind. Eustace Dolph turned
round with a furious, threatening gesture.</p>

<p>"You damned fool!" he thundered; "he's
no bondholder&mdash;he's one of <i>us</i>. Go on, I
tell you! Will you let that nigger get
away?"</p>

<p>He half drove them down the steps. The
old man stepped out, his face aflame under his
white hair, his whole frame quivering.</p>

<p>"You lie, sir!" he cried; but his voice was
drowned in the howl of the mob as it swept
around the corner, forgetting all things else in
the madness of its hideous chase.</p>

<p>When Jacob Dolph returned to his wife's
chamber, her feeble gaze was lifted to the ceiling.
At the sound of his footsteps she let it
fall dimly upon his face. He was thankful
that, in that last moment of doubtful quickening,
she could not read his eyes; and she
passed away, smiling sweetly, one of her white
old hands in his, and one in her child's.</p>

<hr />

<p>Age takes small account of the immediate
flight of time. To the young, a year is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135" href="#Page_135">[135]</a></span>
mighty span. Be it a happy or an unhappy
year that youth looks forward to, it is a
vista that stretches far into the future. And
when it is done, this interminable year, and
youth, just twelve months older, looks back to
the first of it, what a long way off it is! What
tremendous progress we have made! How
much more we know! How insufficient are
the standards by which we measured the world
a poor three hundred and sixty-five days
back!</p>

<p>But age has grown habituated to the flight
of time. Years? we have seen so many of
them that they make no great impression upon
us. What! is it ten years since young Midas
first came to the counting-room, asking humbly
for an entry-clerk's place&mdash;he who is now the
head of the firm? Bless us! it seems like yesterday.
Is it ten years since we first put on
that coat? Why, it must be clean out of the
fashion by this time.</p>

<p>But age does not carry out the thought, and
ask if itself be out of the fashion. Age knows
better. A few wrinkles, a stoop in the back, a
certain slowness of pace, do not make a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136" href="#Page_136">[136]</a></span>
old at sixty&mdash;nor at seventy, neither; for now
you come to think of it, the ten years we were
speaking of is gone, and it is seventy now, and
not sixty. Seventy! Why, 'tis not to be
thought of as old age&mdash;save when it may be
necessary to rebuke the easy arrogance of
youth.</p>

<p>The time had come to Jacob Dolph when he
could not feel that he was growing old. He
was old, of course, in one sense. He was sixty-one
when the war broke out; and they had not
allowed him to form a regiment and go to the
front at its head. But what was old for a
soldier in active service was not old for a well-preserved
civilian. True, he could never be
the same man again, now that poor Aline was
gone. True, he was growing more and more
disinclined for active exercise, and he regretted
he had led so sedentary a life. But though '64
piled itself up on '63, and '65 on top of that,
these arbitrary divisions of time seemed to him
but trivial.</p>

<p>Edith was growing old, perhaps; getting
to be a great girl, taller than her mother
and fairer of complexion, yet not unlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137" href="#Page_137">[137]</a></span>
her, he sometimes thought, as she began to
manage the affairs of the house, and to go
about the great shabby mansion with her
mother's keys jingling at her girdle. For the
years went on crawling one over the other,
and soon it was 1873, and Edith was eighteen
years old.</p>

<p>One rainy day in this year found Jacob
Dolph in Wall Street. Although he himself
did not think so, he was an old man to others,
and kindly hands, such as were to be found
even in that infuriate crowd, had helped him
up the marble steps of the Sub-Treasury and
had given him lodgment on one of the great
blocks of marble that dominate the street.
From where he stood he could see Wall Street,
east and west, and the broad plaza of Broad
Street to the south, filled with a compact mass
of men, half hidden by a myriad of umbrellas,
rain-soaked, black, glinting in the dim light.
So might a Roman legion have looked, when
each man raised his targum above his head and
came shoulder to shoulder with his neighbor
for the assault.</p>

<p>There was a confused, ant-like movement in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138" href="#Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the vast crowd, and a dull murmur came from
it, rising, in places, into excited shouts. Here
and there the fringe of the mass swelled up
and swept against the steps of some building,
forcing, or trying to force, an entry. Sometimes
a narrow stream of men trickled into the
half-open doorway; sometimes the great portals
closed, and then there was a mad outcry
and a low groan, and the foremost on the steps
suddenly turned back, and in some strange
way slipped through the throng and sped in
all directions to bear to hushed or clamorous
offices the news that this house or that bank
had "suspended payment." "Busted," the
panting messengers said to white-faced merchants;
and in the slang of the street was conveyed
the message of doom. The great panic
of 1873 was upon the town&mdash;the outcome of
long years of unwarranted self-confidence, of
selfish extravagance, of conscienceless speculation&mdash;and,
as hour after hour passed by, fortunes
were lost in the twinkling of an eye, and
the bread was taken out of the mouths of the
helpless.</p>

<p>After Jacob Dolph had stood for some time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139" href="#Page_139">[139]</a></span>
looking down upon the tossing sea of black
umbrellas, he saw a narrow lane made through
the crowd in the wake of a little party
of clerks and porters, bearing aid perhaps to
some stricken bank. Slipping down, he followed
close behind them. Perhaps the jostling
hundreds on the sidewalk were gentle with
him, seeing that he was an old man; perhaps
the strength of excitement nerved him, for he
made his way down the street to the flight of
steps leading to the door of a tall white building,
and he crowded himself up among the
pack that was striving to enter. He had even
got so far that he could see the line pouring in
above his head, when there was a sudden cessation
of motion in the press, and one leaf of
the outer iron doors swung forward, meeting
the other, already closed to bar the crush,
and two green-painted panels stood, impassable,
between him and the last of the Dolph
fortune.</p>

<p>One howl and roar, and the crowd turned
back on itself, and swept him with it. In five
minutes a thousand offices knew of the greatest
failure of the day; and Jacob Dolph was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140" href="#Page_140">[140]</a></span>
leaning&mdash;weak, gasping, dazed&mdash;against the
side wall of a hallway in William Street, with
two stray office-boys staring at him out of
their small, round, unsympathetic eyes.</p>

<p>Let us not ask what wild temptation led
the old man back again to risk all he owned
in that hellish game that is played in the narrow
street. We may remember this: that he
saw his daughter growing to womanhood in
that silent and almost deserted house, shouldered
now by low tenements and wretched
shops and vile drinking-places; that he may
have pictured for her a brighter life in that
world that had long ago left him behind it in
his bereaved and disgraced loneliness; that he
had had some vision of her young beauty fulfilling
its destiny amid sweeter and fairer surroundings.
And let us not forget that he
knew no other means than these to win the
money for which he cared little; which he
found absolutely needful.</p>

<p>After Jacob Dolph had yielded for the last
time to the temptation that had conquered
him once before, and had ruined his son's
soul; after that final disastrous battle with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141" href="#Page_141">[141]</a></span>
gamblers of Wall Street, wherein he lost the
last poor remnant of the great Dolph fortune,
giving up with it his father's home forever,
certain old bread of his father's casting
came back to him upon
strange waters.</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/ill-p141.jpg" >
<img class="plain" src="images/ill-p141-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="372" alt="" title="" />
</a></div>

<p>Abram Van
Riper came to the
daughter of
the house of Dolph, a little before it became
certain that the house must be sold, and told
her, in his dry way, that he had to make a
business communication to her, for he feared
that her father was hardly capable of understanding
such matters any longer. She winced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142" href="#Page_142">[142]</a></span>
a little; but he took a load off her heart when
he made his slow, precise explanation. The
fact was, he said, that the business transactions
between her father and himself, consequent
upon the defalcation of her brother
Eustace, had never been closed, in all these
seventeen years. (Edith Dolph trembled.) It
was known at the time that the property
transferred by her father rather more than
covered the amount of her brother's&mdash;peculation.
But her father's extreme sensitiveness
had led him to avoid a precise adjustment,
and as the property transferred was subject to
certain long leases, he, Mr. Van Riper, had
thought it best to wait until the property was
sold and the account closed, to settle the matter
with Mr. Dolph. This had lately been
done, and Mr. Van Riper found that, deducting
charges, and interest on his money at
seven per cent., he had made by the transaction
six thousand three hundred and seventy
dollars. This sum, he thought, properly belonged
to Mr. Dolph. And if Miss Dolph
would take the counsel of an old friend of her
father's, she would leave the sum in charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143" href="#Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the house of Abram Van Riper's Son. The
house would invest it at ten per cent.&mdash;he
stopped and looked at Edith, but she only
answered him with innocent eyes of attention&mdash;and
would pay her six hundred and thirty-seven
dollars annually in quarterly payments.
It might be of assistance to Mr. Dolph in his
present situation.</p>

<p>It was of assistance. They lived on it,
father and daughter, with such aid as Decorative
Art&mdash;just introduced to this country&mdash;gave
in semi-remunerative employment for her
deft fingers.</p>

<p>Abram Van Riper, when he left the weeping,
grateful girl, marched out into the street, turned
his face toward what was once Greenwich Village,
and said to his soul:</p>

<p>"I think that will balance any obligation my
father may have put himself under in buying
that State Street house too cheap. Now then,
old gentleman, you can lie easy in your grave.
The Van Ripers ain't beholden to the Dolphs,
that's sure."</p>

<hr />

<p>A few years ago&mdash;shall we say as many as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144" href="#Page_144">[144]</a></span>
ten?&mdash;there were two small rooms up in a
quiet street in Harlem, tenanted by an old
gentleman and a young gentlewoman; and in
the front room, which was the young woman's
room by night, but a sort of parlor or sitting-room

<span class="figleft">

in the daytime, the
old gentleman stood up,
four times a year, to have
his collar pulled
up, and his
necktie set
right, and his
coat dusted off
by a pair of
small white
hands, so that
he might be presentable when he went down
town to collect certain moneys due him.</p>

<p>They were small rooms, but they were
bright and cheerful, being decorated with
sketches and studies of an artistic sort, which
may have been somewhat crude and uncertain
as to treatment, but were certainly pleasant
and feminine. Yet few saw them save the
young woman and the old man. The most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145" href="#Page_145">[145]</a></span>
frequent visitor was a young artist from the
West, who often escorted Miss Dolph to and
from the Art League rooms. His name was
Rand; he had studied in Munich; he had a
future before him, and was making money
on his prospects. He might just as well have
lived in luxurious bachelor quarters in the
lower part of the city; but, for reasons of his
own, he preferred to live in Harlem.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Dolph insisted on going regularly
every quarter-day to the office of the Van
Riper Estate, "to collect," as he said, "the interest
due him." Four times a year he went
down town on the Eighth Avenue cars, where
the conductors soon learned to know him by
his shiny black broadcloth coat and his snow-white
hair. His daughter was always uneasy
about these trips; but her father could not be
dissuaded from them. To him they were his
one hold on active life&mdash;the all-important
events of the year. It would have broken his
tender old heart to tell him that he could not
go to collect his "interest." And so she set
his necktie right, and he went.</p>

<p>When he got out of the car at Abingdon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146" href="#Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Square he tottered, in his slow, old way, to a
neat structure which combined modern jauntiness
with old-time solidity, and which was
labelled simply: "Office of the Van Riper
Estate," and there he told the smilingly indulgent
clerk that he thought he would "take it
in cash, this time," and, taking it in cash, went
forth.</p>

<p>And then he walked down through Greenwich
Village into New York city, and into the
street where stood the house that his father
had built. Thus he had gone to view it four
times a year, during every year save the first,
since he had given it up.</p>

<p>He had seen it go through one stage of decadence
after another. First it was rented, by
its new owner, to the Jewish pawnbroker, with
his numerous family. Good, honest folk they
were, who tried to make the house look fine,
and the five daughters made the front stoop
resplendent of summer evenings. But they
had long ago moved up-town. Then it was
a cheap boarding-house, and vulgar and flashy
men and women swarmed out in the morning
and in at eventide. Then it was a lodging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147" href="#Page_147">[147]</a></span>-house,
and shabby people let themselves out
and in at all hours of the day and night. And
last of all it had become a tenement-house, and
had fallen into line with its neighbors to left
and right, and the window-panes were broken,
and the curse of misery and poverty and utter
degradation had fallen upon it.</p>

<p>But still it lifted its grand stone front, still it
stood, broad and great, among all the houses
in the street. And it was the old man's custom,
after he had stood on the opposite sidewalk
and gazed at it for a while, to go to
a little French <i>café</i> a block to the eastward,
and there to take a glass of <i>vermouth
gommé</i>&mdash;it was a mild drink, and pleasing to
an old man. Sometimes he chanced to find
some one in this place who would listen to
his talk about the old house&mdash;he was very
grand; but they were decent people who
went to that <i>café</i>, and perhaps would go back
with him a block and look at it. We would
not have talked to chance people in an east-side
French <i>café</i>. But then we have never
owned such a house, and lost it&mdash;and everything
else.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148" href="#Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<hr />

<p>Late one hot summer afternoon young Rand
sat in his studio, working enthusiastically on a
"composition." A new school of art had invaded
New York, and compositions were everything,
for the moment, whether they composed
anything or nothing. He heard a nervous rattling
at his door-knob, and he opened the
door. A young woman lifted a sweet, flushed,
frightened face to his.</p>

<p>"Oh, John," she cried, "father hasn't come
home yet, and it's five o'clock, and he left
home at nine."</p>

<p>John Rand threw off his flannel jacket, and
got into his coat.</p>

<p>"We'll find him; don't worry, dear," he
said.</p>

<p>They found him within an hour. The great
city, having no further use for the old Dolph
house, was crowding it out of existence. With
the crashing of falling bricks, and the creaking
of the tackle that swung the great beams downward,
the old house was crumbling into a gap
between two high walls. Already you could
see through to where the bright new bricks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149" href="#Page_149">[149]</a></span>
were piled at the back to build the huge eight-story
factory that was to take its place. But
it was not to see this demolition that the crowd
was gathered, filling the narrow street. It
stood, dense, ugly, vulgar, stolidly intent, gazing
at the windows of the house opposite&mdash;a
poor tenement house.</p>

<p>As they went up the steps they met the
young hospital surgeon, going back to his ambulance.</p>

<p>"You his folks?" he inquired. "Sorry to tell
you so, but I can't do any good. Sunstroke,
I suppose&mdash;may have been something else&mdash;but
it's collapse now, and no mistake. You
take charge, sir?" he finished, addressing
Rand.</p>

<p>Jacob Dolph was lying on his back in the
bare front room on the first floor. His daughter
fell on her knees by his side, and made as
though she would throw her arms around
him; but, looking in his face, she saw death
quietly coming upon him, and she only bent
down and kissed him, while her tears wet his
brow.</p>

</a></div>

<p>Meanwhile a tall Southerner, with hair halfway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150" href="#Page_150">[150]</a></span>
down his neck, and kindly eyes that
moved in unison with his broad gestures, was
talking to Rand.</p>

<p>"I met the ol' gentleman in the French
<i>café</i>, neah heah," he said, "and he was jus'
honing to have me come
up and see his
house, seh&mdash;house
he used to have.
Well, I came right
along, an' when we got here, sure 'nough,
they's taihin' down that house. Neveh felt so
bad in all my life, seh. He wasn't expectin'
of it, and I 'lowed 'twuz his old home like,
and he was right hahd hit, fo' a fact. He said
to me, 'Good-day, seh,' sezee; 'good-day,
seh,' he says to me, an' then he starts across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151" href="#Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the street, an' first thing I know, he falls down
flat on his face, seh. Saw that theah brick
an' mortar comin' down, an' fell flat on his face.
This hyeh pill-man 'lowed 'twuz sunstroke;
but a Southern man like I am don't need to
be told what a gentleman's feelings are when
he sees his house a-torn down&mdash;no, seh. If
you ever down oweh way, seh, I'd be right
glad&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Rand had lifted Edith from the floor,
for her father would know her no more, and
had passed out of this world, unconscious of
all the squalor and ruin about him; and the
poor girl was sobbing on his shoulder.</p>

<p>He was very tender with her, very sorry for
her&mdash;but he had never known the walls that
fell across the way; he was a young man, an
artist, with a great future before him, and the
world was young to him, and she was to be
his wife.</p>

<p>Still, looking down, he saw that sweetly
calm, listening look, that makes beautiful the
faces of the dead, come over the face of Jacob
Dolph, as though he, lying there, heard the
hammers of the workmen breaking down his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152" href="#Page_152">[152]</a></span>
father's house, brick by brick&mdash;and yet the
sound could no longer jar upon his ear or
grieve his gentle spirit.</p>
